Summary

Package requirement: gps Sub-menu: /system gps Standards: GPS, NMEA 0183, Simple Text Output Protocol

Global Positioning System (GPS) is used for determining the precise location of a GPS receiver.

### Configuration Properties

Property Description

channel (integer [0..4294967295]; Default: )0 Port channel used by the device

coordinate-format (dd | dms | ddmm; Default: no) Which coordinate format to use, "Decimal Degrees", "Degrees Minutes Seconds" or "NMEA format DDDMM.MM[MM]"

enabled (yes | no; Default: no) Whether GPS is enabled

gps-antenna-select (external | internal; Default: i Depending on the model. Internal antenna can be selected, if the device has one installed. nternal)

init-channel (integer [0..4294967295]; Default: ) Channel for init-string execution

init-string (string; Default: ) AT init string for GPS initialization

port (string; Default: ) Name of the USB/Serial port where the GPS receiver is connected

set-system-time (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to set the router's date and time to one received from GPS.

### Monitoring Status

Command: /system gps monitor

This command is used for monitoring the data received from a GPS receiver.

Parameters:

Starting with the 7.1rc3 firmware release, a new parameter was added, called "data-age" (measured in seconds). This parameter displays the time that has passed since the device received the last NMEA message.

Property Description

date-and-time (date) Date and time received from GPS

latitude (none | string) Latitude in DM (Degrees Minute decimal) format

longitude (none | string) Longitude in DM (Degrees Minute decimal) format

altitude (none | string) Altitude based on GPS data

speed (none | string) The current moving speed of the GPS unit

destination-bearing (none | string) The direction toward which a GPS is moving

|true-bearing (none | string) magnetic-bearing (none | string) valid (yes | no) satellites (integer) fix-quality (integer) horizontal-dilution (integer) data-age (integer) Basic examples|The direction toward which a GPS is moving The direction toward which a GPS is moving Number of satellites seen by the device.

Port and GPS settings for LtAP

/port set serial1 baud-rate=115200

/system gps set port=serial1 channel=0 enabled=yes

We have also created an in-depth article about live GPS tracking, using scripting and a web server: GPS-tracking.

Troubleshooting

Note that sometimes to make the GPS module recognized in RouterOS you need to change the baud-rate setting in the '/port' menu.

LtAP mini has a low-gain GPS antenna built-in and for a better experience, we suggest using an additional external antenna.

Switch between internal and external antennas under the GPS menu:

[admin@MikroTik] > /system gps set gps-antenna-select=external

On some modems with GPS support, you need to send multiple init commands for continuous GPS monitoring, for example, for Huawei cards you need to send "AT^WPDST=1,AT^WPDGP" init string to get continuous monitoring.
