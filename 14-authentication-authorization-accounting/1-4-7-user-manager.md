## Overview

User Manager is RADIUS server implementation in RouterOS which provides centralized user authentication and authorization to a certain service. Having a central user database allows better tracking of system users and customers. As a separate package, User Manager is available on all architectures except SMIPS, however, care must be taken due to limited free space available. It supports many different authentication methods including PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-PEAP. In RouterOS, DHCP, Dot1x, Hotspot, IPsec, PPP, and Wireless are features that benefit from User Manager the most. Each user can see their account statistics and manage available profiles using the WEB interface. Additionally, users can buy their own data plans (profiles) using the most popular payment gateway-PayPal making it a great system for service providers. Customized reports can be generated to ease processing by the billing department. User Manager works according to RADIUS standards defined in RFC2865 and RFC3579.

User Manager is one of the RouterOS features, that is limited by the RouterOS license level. Depending on the License level, number of active sessions will be limited, including multiple connections per user (not unique accounts).

Access-WEP encryption key for the client (wireless only). Accept

Access-Datarate limitation for clients. The format is: rx-rate[/tx-rate] [rx-burst-rate[/tx-burst-rate] [rx-burst-threshold[ Accept /tx-burst-threshold] [rx-burst-time[/tx-burst-time] [priority] [rx-rate-min[/tx-rate-min]]]] from the point of view of the router (so "rx" is client upload, and "tx" is client download). All rates should be numbers with optional 'k' (1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If the tx-rate is not specified, the rx-rate is as tx-rate too. The same goes for tx- burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate are used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as default. Priority takes values 1..8, where 1 implies the highest priority, but 8 - the lowest. If rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min are not specified rx-rate and tx-rate values are used. The rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min values can not exceed rx-rate and tx-rate values. Access-If it is set in /radius menu, it is included in every RADIUS request as Mikrotik-Realm attribute.

The MikroTik RADIUS client upon receiving this attribute Accept creates a dynamic firewall mangle rule with action=jump chain=hotspot and jump-target equal to the attribute value. Mangle chain name can have suffixes .in or .out, which will install rule only for incoming or outgoing traffic. Multiple Mark-id attributes can be provided, but only the last ones for incoming and outgoing are used. Access-URL of the page with advertisements that should be displayed to clients. If this attribute is specified, Accept advertisements are enabled automatically, including transparent proxy, even if they were explicitly disabled in the corresponding user profile.

Properties

Property Description

name (string; Default: ) Name of the attribute.

packet-types (string; Default: access-accept) access-accept-use this attribute in RADIUS Access-Accept messages access-challenge-use this attribute in RADIUS Access-Challenge messages

type-id (integer:1..255; Default: ) Attribute identification number from the specific vendor's attribute database.

value-type (string; Default: ) hex ip-address-IPv4 or IPv6 IP address ip6-prefix-IPv6 prefix macro string uint32

vendor-id (integer; Default: )0 IANA allocated a specific enterprise identification number.

## Database

Sub-menu: /user-manager database

All RADIUS-related information is stored in a separate User Manager's database configurable under the "database" sub-menu. "Enabled" and "db-path" are the only parameters that are not stored in the User Manager's database and instead are stored in the main RouterOS configuration table meaning that these parameters will be affected by the RouterOS configuration reset. The rest of the configuration, session, and payment data is stored in a separate SQLite database on the FLASH storage of the device. When performing any actions with databases, it is advised to make a backup before and after any activity.

Properties

Property Description

db-path (string; Default: ) Path to the location where database files will be stored.

Read-only properties

Property Description

optimize-db ()

save (name; overwrite) Save the current state of the User Manager database.

## Limitations

Sub-menu: /user-manager limitation

Limitations are used by Profiles and are linked together by Profile-Limitations. RADIUS accounting and Interim updates must be enabled to seamlessly switch between multiple limitations or disconnect active sessions when download-limit upload-limit, or uptime-limit is reached.

To disconnect already active sessions from User Manager, accept must be set to yes on the RADIUS client side. If simultaneous session limits are not unlimited (shared-users) and it has reached the maximum allowed number, then the router will try to disconnect the older user session first.

User-Manager attempts to disconnect an active session before a new user will be accepted (when the appropriate limit is set), that's why in such setups it is suggested to use 1s for /radius client timeout.

IPsec service in RouterOS does not support rate limitations.

## User Profiles

Sub-menu: /user-manager user-profile

This menu assigns users a profile and tracks the status of the profile. A single user can have multiple profiles assigned, however, only one can be used at the same time. A user will seamlessly be switched to the next profile when the currently active profile expires without dropping the user's session.

Properties

Property Description

profile (profile; Default: ) Name of the profile to assign for user.

user (user; Default: ) Name of the user to use particular profile.

Read-only properties

Property Description

Application Guides It is possible to create multiple new users with randomly generated usernames and passwords. For example, the following command will generate 3 new users with 6 lowercase symbols as the username and 6 lowercase, uppercase, and numbers as the password.|
|/user-manager user|add-batch-users number-of-users=3 password-characters=lowercase,numbers,uppercase password-length=6 username- characters=lowercase username-length=6 The command generated users can be seen by printing the user's table:|
|Flags: X-disabled|/user-manager user print 0 name="olsgkl" password="86a6zH" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes="" 1 name="lkbwss" password="jaKY5V" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes="" 2 name="cwxbwu" password="a62yZd" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes="" Providing NAS with custom RADIUS attributes It is possible to send additional RADIUS attributes during the authentication process to provide NAS with custom information about the session, such as what IP address should be assigned to the supplicant or what address pool to use for address assigning. Static IP address for a user To assign the end user a static IP address, Framed-IP-Address attribute can be used. When using static IP address allocation, shared-sessions must be set to 1 to prevent cases when a user has multiple simultaneous sessions, but there is only one IP address. For example:|

/user-manager user set [find name=username] shared-users=1 attributes=Framed-IP-Address:192.168.1.4

Specifying address pool for a group of users

We can group up multiple similar users and assign RADIUS attributes to all of them at once. First of all, create a new group:

/user-manager user group add name=location1 outer-auths=chap,eap-mschap2,eap-peap,eap-tls,eap-ttls,mschap1,mschap2,pap \ inner-auths=peap-mschap2,ttls-chap,ttls-mschap1,ttls-mschap2,ttls-pap attributes=Framed-Pool:pool1

The next step is to assign a user to the group:

/user-manager user set [find name=username] group=location1

In this case, an IP address from pool1 will be assigned to the user upon authentication-make sure pool1 is created on the NAS device.

Using TOTP (time-based one-time password) for user authentication

User Manager supports time-based authentication token addition to the user's password field that is regenerated every 30 seconds.

OTP depends on the clock, so make sure time settings are configured correctly.

TOTP works by having a shared secret on the supplicant (client) and the authentication server (User Manager). To configure TOTP on RouterOS, simply set the otp-secret for the user. For example:

/user-manager user set [find name=username] password=mypass otp-secret=mysecret

To calculate the TOTP token on the supplicant side, many widely available applications can be used, for example, Google Authenticator or https://totp.app/. Adding mysecret to the TOTP token generator will provide a new unique 6-digit code that must be added to the user password.

The following example will accept the user's authentication with a calculated TOTP token added to the common password until a new TOTP token is generated, for example,

User-Name=username User-Password=mypass620872

### Exporting user credentials

Printable login credentials for a single user

To generate a single user's printable voucher card, simply use the generate-voucher command. Specify the RouterOS ID number of the user or use the find command to specify a username. A template is already included in User Manager's installation available in the Files section of your device. You can customize the template for your needs.

/user-manager user generate-voucher voucher-template=printable_vouchers.html [find where name=username]

The generated voucher card is available by accessing the router using a WEB browser and navigating to /um/PRIVATE/GENERATED/vouchers /gen_printable_vouchers.html

By default, the printable card looks like this:

To access the PRIVATE path of the /um/ directory by the WEB browser, private-username and private-password must be configured. See Settin gs section.

It is possible to use different variables when generating vouchers. Currently, supported variables are:

$(username) - Represents User Manager username $(password) - Password of the username $(userprofname) - Profile that is active for the particular user $(userprofendtime) - Profile validity end time if specified

Multiple user credential export

It is possible to generate a CSV or XML file with multiple or all user credentials at once by using the export.xml or export.csv as voucher-template.

/user-manager user generate-voucher voucher-template=export.xml [find]

The command generates an XML file um5files/PRIVATE/GENERATED/vouchers/gen_export.xml which can either be accessible by the WEB browser or any other file access tools.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <users> <user> <username>olsgkl</username> <password>86a6zH</password> </user> <user> <username>lkbwss</username> <password>jaKY5V</password> </user> <user> <username>cwxbwu</username> <password>a62yZd</password> </user> <user> <username>username</username> <password>secretpassword</password> </user>

</users>

### Generating usage report

In cases where presentable network usage information is required by companies billing or legal team an automated session export can be created using the generate-report command. The command requires an input of the report template-an example of the template is available in um5files/PRIVATE /TEMPLATES/reports/report_default.html. Example of the report generation:

/user-manager generate-report report-template=report_default.html columns=username,uptime,download,upload

The generated report is available by accessing the router using a WEB browser and navigating to /um/PRIVATE/GENERATED/reports/gen_report_default. html

### Purchasing a profile

After logging into the user's private profile by accessing the router's /um/ directory using a WEB browser, for example, http://example.com/um/, he will be able to see all available Profiles in the respective menu. Profiles that have specified price values will have a Buy this Profile button available.

After pressing the Buy this Profile button, the user will be asked to choose from available transaction service providers (currently only PayPal is available) and later redirected to PayPal's payment processing page.

When the payment is completed, the User Manager will ask PayPal to approve the transaction. After approval, the profile is assigned to the user and is ready to use.

### Migrating from RouterOS v6

When you upgrade your User Manager router from RouterOS v6 to the v7 the new User Manager will work with new database files and configuration. To continue using the old user, router, profile, etc. configuration you must manually execute the migrate command. To do so you must have files from the old User Manager server folder "user-manager" present. The folder can be renamed, but all the contents from the old installation must be transferred to the new v7 installation (you can move the old configuration from one router to another router with v7, you must copy "user-manager" folder). After that, all you need to do is execute this command - "/user-manager/database/migrate-legacy-db database-path=<path_to_old_user_manager_folder>".

The import process will try to convert such configuration-users, profiles, user-profiles, limitations, profile-limitations, user-counters, routers, and sessions.

## Application Examples

Basic L2TP/IPsec server with User Manager authentication

User Manager configuration

Start off by enabling User Manager functionality.

/user-manager set enabled=yes

Allow receiving RADIUS requests from the localhost (the router itself).

/user-manager router add address=127.0.0.1 comment=localhost name=local shared-secret=test

Next, add users and their credentials that clients will use to authenticate to the server.

/user-manager user add name=user1 password=password

Configuring RADIUS client

For the router to use the RADIUS server for user authentication, it is required to add a new RADIUS client that has the same shared secret that we already configured on User Manager.

/radius add address=127.0.0.1 secret=test service=ipsec

L2TP/IPsec server configuration

Configure the IP pool from which IP addresses will be assigned to the users and assign it to the PPP Profile.

/ip pool add name=vpn-pool range=192.168.99.2-192.168.99.100

/ppp profile set default-encryption local-address=192.168.99.1 remote-address=vpn-pool

Enable the use of RADIUS for PPP authentication.

/ppp aaa set use-radius=yes

Enable the L2TP server with IPsec encryption.

/interface l2tp-server server set enabled=yes use-ipsec=required ipsec-secret=mySecret

That is it. Your router is now ready to accept L2TP/IPsec connections and authenticate them to the internal User Manager.

Two factor authentication for RouterOS user login (MFA/2FA)

As User-Manager supports TOTP (time-based-one-time password), it is possible to setup so called MFA authentication for different services. Here will will look into RouterOS user authentication over User Manager (radius) with time based password, that is changed every 30 seconds.

Here are the necessary configuration options on your MikroTik router,

Enable to use RADIUS for /user menu, and set default-grop from /user group menu. Keep in mind that local /user database is checked first, and then RADIUS is contacted.

/user/aaa/set use-radius=yes default-group=full

Enable radius client for login service. As we run User Manager on the same router, 127.0.0.1 is used, /radius/add address=127.0.0.1 service=login secret=mystrongsecret

Here are the configuration steps for User Manager,

Make sure you have added your managed devices to "Routers" menu, /user-manager/router/add name=myrouter address=127.0.0.1 shared-secret=mystrongsecret

Add user to User-Manager user table with OTP secret parameter. Few more steps are required for proper OTP configuration. Pick OTP-secret name and convert it to base32 format (there are plenty of online converters from utf-8 to base32 format). For my configuration I use "mysupersecret", that in base32 would be NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI=== /user-manager/user/add name=mikrotik password=mysuperpassword otp-secret="NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI==="

Note, than in your favorite authenticator app, you will need to set user this key manually "NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI===", when adding new time password instance.

To login to your MikroTik device, open Winbox/Console and connect to your router address, use login:mikrotik and password:mysuperpasswordxxxxxx, where xxxxxx is 6 digit code from your favorite authentication app.

Password is changed every 30 seconds and it is available from your favorite app.
