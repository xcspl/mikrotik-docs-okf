# Load Balancing

Failover (WAN Backup) OSPF Load Balancing (restricted) Per connection classifier

## Introduction

Network load balancing is the ability to balance traffic across two or more links without using dynamic routing protocols.

There are two type of balancing methods:

per-packet-each packet of a single stream can be forwarded over different links. This method will work reliably especially on TCP and secure connections only when you are able to control both balancing endpoints. per-connection-all packets of the same connection (stream) is always sent over one link. This method is mandatory in setups where only one end of the balancing is under our control, for example, home router with multiple WAN connections.

||Method|Per-connection|Per-packet|
|---|---|---|---|
||Nth|Yes|Yes|
|Firewall Mangle|PCC (Per Connection Classifier)|Yes|No|
||Other matchers|Yes|Yes|
|ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path)||Yes|No|
||Bonding|No|Yes|
||OSPF|Yes|No|
||BGP|Yes|No|

## Simple Failover Example

Simplest failover setup would be to use multiple gateways when one gateway is active and another one takes over when the first one fails.

To make this work, configure larger distance value for the secondary one, and check-gateway for the first one:

/ip route add gateway=192.168.1.1 distance=1 check-gateway=ping /ip route add gateway=192.168.2.1 distance=2

The check-gateway will make sure the gateway is up only when actual traffic can reach the gateway. When the ping fails the first gateway will become inactive and the second one will take over,  and when the first gateway recovers  it will become active and make the second gateway to work again as a backup.

# Failover (WAN Backup)

## Introduction

In this article, we will look at another advanced method of failover using recursive routing and scopes from the routing section. Recursive routing occurs when a route (either static or dynamically learned) has a next-hop that is not directly connected to the local router. It is necessary to restrict a set of routes that can be used to look up immediate next-hops. Nexthop values of RIP or OSPF routes, for example, are supposed to be directly reachable and should be looked up only using connected routes. This is achieved using a scope and target-scope properties.

## Setup Overview

Let's assume that our gateway has two public network uplinks ("ISP1", "ISP2"). First uplink should be preferred and second one should act as a backup.

Then we mark traffic in two parts, one with the name "ISP1" and the second as "ISP2" which goes through the ether1 and ether2 accordingly. In this setup, we want to monitor two hosts: Host1 and Host2. We will use Google DNS servers with IP 8.8.8.8 (Host1) and 8.8.4.4 (Host2), but it is not mandatory to use specifically these addresses.

## Configuration

### Basic failover

First things first, since we have a local address space we need to masquerade LAN traffic on both uplinks:

/ip/firewall/nat add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1 add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether2

Next we want to pick two hosts on the internet and make them reachable each on its own uplink. Generally you would pick hosts that are always supposed to be reachable, accepts ICMP, in this example we will use google DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).

/ip/route/ add dst-address=8.8.8.8 scope=10 gateway=10.111.0.1 add dst-address=8.8.4.4 scope=10 gateway=10.112.0.1

And add default routes recursively resolved over both hosts with ISP1 being the primary one (by having smaller distance):

/ip/route/ add distance=1 gateway=8.8.8.8 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping add distance=2 gateway=8.8.4.4 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping

### Improve detection reliability

At this point we are relying link reachability on a single host. Even though google services are very rarely down we can still improve reliability by adding a second host on each link.

/ip/route add dst-address=208.67.222.222 gateway=10.111.0.1 scope=10 add dst-address=208.67.220.220 gateway=10.112.0.1 scope=10

add distance=1 gateway=208.67.222.222 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping add distance=2 gateway=208.67.220.220 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping

Essentially what it does is creates ECMP default route and if only one of the gateways is not reachable default route on the first link will still be active. Complete switchover to second link will happen only if all the gateways become unreachable.
