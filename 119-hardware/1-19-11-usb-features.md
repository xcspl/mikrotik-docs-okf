# USB Features

Summary USB Power Reset USB Port Type USB Port Mode RouterBoard USB Port Limitations

## Summary

Sub-menu: /system routerboard usb Package: system (v6, v7)

This article describes RouterBoard device supported USB features.

## USB Power Reset

USB power reset turns off USB port power for a specified time. It is useful when 3G/LTE modem needs to be restarted but there is no physical access to it.

Available properties:

duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off.

For example, turn off USB port power for 10 seconds:

/system routerboard usb power-reset duration=10s

RouterBoards with multiple USB buses also require a bus specified in order to do a USB power reset. Available properties:

duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off. bus (integer; Default: 1) - USB bus where power reset is applied.

RB953GS: The miniPCIe slot closer to Ethernet ports on the RB953GS board is the one which is shared with USB port and has configurable US B port type, its USB bus number is 1. Depending on USB port type the power reset is done on USB port or miniPCIe slot. The other miniPCIe slot closer to SFP slots has independent bus - 2.

RB922UAG: The USB port has an independent bus - 1. The miniPCIe slot has an independent bus - 2.

CCR1072-1G-8S+: The micro USB port has independent bus - 0. The USB Type-A port has independent bus - 1.

## USB Port Type

Boards with switchable USB port routing have shared USB lines which can be routed to external USB-Type port or mini-PCIe slot. For more reference see board block diagram in document section on board specification page.

[admin@MikroTik] > /system routerboard usb set type= USB-type-A auto mini-PCIe

auto (default) During RouterOS startup check if USB device in mini-PCIe slot:

if present-use device in mini-PCIe slot if not present-defaults to external USB Type A port

USB-type-A Use USB devices connected to USB  Type A connector

mini-PCIe Routee USB lines to corresponding mini-PCIe slot

RB953GS: The miniPCIe slot closer to Ethernet ports on the RB953GS board is the one which is shared with USB port and has configurable US B port type, its USB bus number is 1. Depending on USB port type the power reset is done on USB port or miniPCIe slot. The other miniPCIe slot closer to SFP slots has independent bus - 2.

## USB Port Mode

RB2011 series, CRS1xx series, and mAP have micro USB port which operates in host mode when USB device is attached through USB OTG cable. Some vendor cables require forced host mode to recognize connected device.

Available properties:

usb-mode (automatic | force-host; Default: "automatic") - Defines USB port mode.

Warning

On RB2011 and CRS1xx series boards USB devices may not work first time they are plugged in. In such cases power cycle (not reboot) is required.
