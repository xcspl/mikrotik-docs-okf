# RouterBOARD

Introduction Properties Upgrading RouterBOOT Settings Preboot etherboot Protected bootloader Support on older MikroTik hardware Mode and Reset buttons

## Introduction

On RouterBOARD devices, the following menu exists which gives you some basic information about your device:

[admin@demo.mt.lv] /system routerboard> print routerboard: yes model: 1200 serial-number: 3B5E02741BF0 firmware-type: amcc460 factory-firmware: 2.38 current-firmware: 7.1beta3 upgrade-firmware: 7.2

## Properties

Read-only properties:

upgrade-RouterOS upgrades also include new RouterBOOT version files, but they have to be applied manually. This line shows if a new firmware ( RouterBOOT file has been found in the device. The file can either be included via a recent RouterOS upgrade or an FWF file that has string) been manually uploaded to the router. In either case, the newest found version will be shown here.

## Upgrading RouterBOOT

Choose the way RouterBOOT loads the operating system:

ethernet-boot the device in Etherboot mode; flash-boot -Flashfig mode on startup is enabled. This setting will revert to NAND after a successful configuration change OR once any user logs into the board. flash-boot-once-then-nand-Flashfig mode on startup is enabled for a single boot only, resets to nand-if-fail-then- ethernet after that. nand-if-fail-then-ethernet - boot RouterOS from the NAND, if RouterOS is not booting-it goes to Etherboot automatically. This is the default mode for devices straight out of the box; nand-only - boot RouterOS from the NAND; try-ethernet-once-then-nand-boot device in E therboot mode once and if no server is available-it will boot directly from the NAND or of the storage type the device is using.

Note

Etherboot mode is a special state for a MikroTik device that allows you to reinstall your device using Netinstall.

There are several ways to put your device into Etherboot mode depending on the device you are using:

1. Press the Reset button and power on your device (wait until "USR" led is blinking then stable "On" and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall.
2. Using the serial console, when the device is booting up, keep pressing CTRL+E on your keyboard until the device shows that it is trying bootp protocol
3. Using the serial console, press any key while the device is booting and choose "o" then "1" and "x"
init-delay (timeout interval 0s..9s; Default: )

This option allows for changing the CPU frequency of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options, hit the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in S version 7 on the keyboard at this promptRouterO

Whether to enter CPU suspend mode in HTL instruction. Most OSs use HLT instruction during the CPU idle cycle. When the CPU is in suspend mode, it consumes less power, but in low-temperature conditions, it is recommended to choose a regular mode, so that the overall system temperature would be higher

Disable this to avoid accidental setting reset via the onboard jumper

Which key will cause the BIOS to enter configuration mode during boot delay. Useful when the serial console prints out symbols during the boot process and goes into RouterBOOT menu by itself. Note that in some serial terminal programs, it is impossible to use the Delete key to enter the setup-in this case, it might be possible to do this with the Backspace key

If to use the backup RouterBOOT. This is only useful if the main loader has become corrupted somehow and cannot be fixed. So that you don't have to boot the device with a pushed reset button (which loads the backup loader), you can use this setting to load it every time

yes-backup loader will be used always no-main booter will be used

Used for mPCIe modems with RB9xx series devices only

In case your modem is not being recognized after a soft reboot, then you might need to add a delay before the USB port is initialized

memory-frequency (dep This option allows changing the memory frequency of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options, ends on model; Default: hit the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in RouterOS version 7 button on the keyboard at this prompt depends on model)

memory-data-rate (dep This option allows changing the memory data rate of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options, hit ends on the model; the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in erOS version 7 button on the keyboard at this promptRout Default: depends on model)

preboot-etherboot (time Enables preboot etherboot, which runs before the regular boot device. It works the same as boot-device=etherboot, but out interval 1s..30s; has an additional timeout value. If an IP address is not received from the Netinstall server before the timeout expires, the Default: disabled) regular booting process will start.

Note

The preboot-etherboot configuration is stored in the BIOS, downgrading RouterOS to older versions will not disable it. This feature can be disabled from the RouterOS menu or by resetting the BIOS.

Since etherboot accepts IP addresses from any BOOTP/DHCP server, use preboot-etherboot-server to start etherboot only when address is received from specified Netinstall server.

preboot-etherboot-Sets preboot-etherboot to accept IP address only from the specified Netinstall server IP address. By enabling this feature, server (IP address, any: unintentional etherboot from other BOOTP/DHCP servers can be prevented. Default: any)

regulatory-domain-ce (y Enables extra-low TX power for high antenna gain devices (requires a reboot) es | no; Default: no)

silent-boot (yes | no; This option disables beeping sounds during booting Default: no) yes-no booting beeps (does not disable the RouterOS: beep command) no-regular booting sound

disable-pci (yes | no; Specific setting for devices with the MT7621 chip. Allows disabling PCI. Default: no)

preferred-architecture Specific setting for L009 devices. Allows to update the device to use ARM64 architecture. (video) (arm32 | arm64; Default: arm32)

etherboot-port (interface Allows selecting Etherboot/Netinstall interface, only applies to CRS520, CRS804, CRS812. Default port depends on the; Default: ) model.

gpio-function (port; Specific setting for M33 devices. By default pins 12,13,15,16 are configured for the second "serial1" port usage, they can Default: serial1) be resigned for GPIO usage in /iot/gpio/digital menu. (GPIO pinout)

If the CPU or memory is overclocked and that is the reason why the router is not performing as suspected, then this is not considered a warranty case and you should return both frequencies to a nominal value.

### Preboot etherboot

preboot-etherboot is a feature that instructs RouterOS device to search for a Netinstall server on every boot for specified amount of time, before starting the regular booting process (e.g., RouterOS). This feature is particularly useful for remote reinstall, as it allows the device to attempt etherboot on every startup.

preboot-etherboot-server specifies that the preboot-etherboot booter should look only for a Netinstall server with a specific IP address. Since by default, etherboot accepts address from any BOOTP/DHCP server,  with this feature, you can specify to accept the address only from a particular Netinstall server, meaning that the device can be reinstalled without removing it from the network.

With both features enabled, any device can be reinstalled remotely without accessing RouterOS or holding the reset button. One example of starting a remote reinstall process would be to simply power cycle RouterOS device from a PoE switch or another power controller. After installation, disable your Netinstall server and simply power cycle the installed device.

To enable preboot-etherboot and preboot-etherboot-server:

1) Install RouterOS version 7.9+
2) Upgrade RouterBOOT with "/system routerboard upgrade"
3) Reboot The feature can be set with command: system/routerboard/settings/set preboot-etherboot=9s preboot-etherboot-server=10.155.115.199 On every next reboot/power cycle, this device will try to receive IP address from Netinstall server with IP 10.155.115.199, for 9 seconds. If there will be no such server, regular boot process will start. In case if the preboot-etherboot is set to boot from any IP (preboot-etherboot-server is not specified), the device will enter etherboot mode from any Netinstall/DHCP server-provided IP address and will wait for the reinstall process. Also, note that RouterOS reinstall does not affect BIOS settings, and preboot-etherboot would still be enabled and would try to enter etherboot. To avoid this scenario without accessing RouterOS, simply disable any attached Netinstall/DHCP server.
### Protected bootloader

The feature allows the protection of RouterOS configuration and files from a physical attacker by disabling etherboot. It is called "Protected RouterBOOT". This feature can be enabled and disabled only from within RouterOS after login, i.e., there is no RouterBOOT setting to enable/disable this feature. These extra options appear only under certain conditions. When this setting is enabled-both the reset button and the reset pin-hole are disabled. RouterBOOT menu is also disabled. The only ability to change boot mode or enable the RouterBOOT settings menu is through RouterOS. If you do not know the RouterOS password-your device can not be recovered!

Starting from the v7 version, when enabling or making any changes to the protected-routerboard feature the reset or mode button must be pressed for confirmation.

For example, when setting protected-routeboard enabled, you will be given 60 seconds to confirm by pressing the reset button, otherwise, this setting won't be enabled.

[admin@450] > system/routerboard/settings/set protected-routerboot=enabled [admin@450] > system/routerboard/settings/print ;;; press button within 60 seconds to confirm protected routerboot enable auto-upgrade: no baud-rate: 115200 boot-delay: 2s enter-setup-on: any-key boot-device: nand-if-fail-then-ethernet cpu-frequency: auto boot-protocol: bootp enable-jumper-reset: yes force-backup-booter: no silent-boot: yes protected-routerboot: enabled reformat-hold-button: 20s reformat-hold-button-max: 10m

Property Description

protected-This setting disables any access to the RouterBOOT configuration settings over a console cable and disables the operation of the routerboot (e reset button to change the boot mode (Netinstall will be disabled). Access to RouterOS will only be possible with a known RouterOS nabled | admin password. Unsetting of this option is only possible from RouterOS. If you forget the RouterOS password, the only option is to disabled; perform a complete reformat of both NAND and RAM with the following method, but you have to know the reset button hold time in Default: disa seconds. bled) enabled-secure mode, only RouterOS can be accessed with a RouterOS admin password. Any user input from the serial port is ignored. Etherboot is not available, RouterBOOT setting change is not possible. disabled-regular operation, RouterBOOT settings available with serial console and reset button can be used to launch Netinstall

reformat-As an emergency recovery option, it is possible to reset everything by pressing the button at power-on for longer than reformat-hold- hold-button ( button time, but less than reformat-hold-button-max (new in RouterBOOT 3.38.3). 5s .. 300s; When you use the button for a complete reset, the following actions are taken: Default: 20s) **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**. Use this only if you have lost all access to the device.

1. RouterOS, all of its files and configuration is completely and irreversibly erased by nand re-format;
2. All RouterBOOT settings are reset to defaults;
3. Board is rebooted;
4. As boot from NAND fails, it goes to etherboot automatically;
5. Netinstall is required to reinstall RouterOS.
Please note! Reformat on some RouterBOARDS can take more than 5 minutes. After formatting the board will be ready for Netinstall.

reformat-Increase the security even further by setting the max hold time, this means that you must release the reset button within a specified hold-button-time interval. If you set the "reformat-hold-button" to 60s and "reformat-hold-button-max" to 65s, it will mean that you must hold the max (15s .. button 60 to 65 seconds, not less and not more, making guesses impossible. Introduced in RouterBOOT 3.38.3 600s; Default: 10m)

RouterBOARD that has the protected RouterBOOT setting enabled will blink the LED every second, to make counting easier. The LED will turn off for one second, and turn on for the next second.

Support on older MikroTik hardware

This section only applies to older devices that display a particular error message! Do not change the bootloader without seeing a message instructing you to do it.

The protected RouterBOOT feature is supported by all modern MikroTik devices, but if you have and old device, if your factory-firmware version is lower than 7.19.3 and your device displays the message → The "protected routerboot" feature requires a backup-routerboot upgrade ← when trying to enable the feature, do the following:

upgrade or downgrade the device specifically to the RouterOS 7.19.3 release (from our download page or archive); upgrade your current RouterBOOT version with "/system routerboard upgrade" then reboot the device, so that the RouterBOOT version (current- firmware version when checking "/system routerboard print") is the same as the firmware version ("/system resource print") installed, which should be 7.19.3; upload the the v7 universal package for all architectures to the device and reboot the device again. This will make your factory-firmware version 7.

19.3, where you are allowed to enable the feature. After this step, you can upgrade the device to a newer release.
If your RouterOS version is v6 and you get the same prompt, follow the same steps mentioned above, but only update/downgrade/compare your device version to specifically 6.49.7 instead and use v6 universal package for all architectures.

### Mode and Reset buttons

Reset button additional functionality is supported by all MikroTik devices running RouterOS

Some RouterBOARD devices have a mode button that allows you to run any script when the button it pushed.
