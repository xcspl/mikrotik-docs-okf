# Product Naming

Introduction RouterBOARD products naming details Board Name Board Features Built-in wireless details Enclosure type Example CloudCoreRouter naming details CloudRouterSwitch and CloudSmartSwitch naming details

## Introduction

MikroTik product naming can be confusing at first glance, but all the product codes have a logical explanation and follow a code.

## RouterBOARD products naming details

RouterBOARD (short version RB)

<board name> <board features>-<built-in wireless> <wireless card features>-<connector type>-<enclosure type>

### Board Name

Currently, there can be three types of board names:

3-symbol name 1st symbol stands for series (this can either be a number or a letter); New additions: D-Dakota; C-Cypress; S-Chateau; L-Maple; E-Econet; MA-Miami; 2nd digit for indicating the number of potential wired interfaces (Ethernet, SFP, SFP+) 3rd digit for indicating the number of potential wireless interfaces (built-in and mPCI and mPCIe slots)

Word - currently used names are: OmniTIK, Groove, SXT, SEXTANT, Metal, LHG, DynaDish, cAP, wAP, LDF, DISC, mANTBox, QRT, DynaDish, cAP, hAP, hEX. If the board has fundamental changes in hardware (such as completely different CPU) revision version will be added at the end

Exceptional naming - 600, 800, 1000, 1100, 1200, 2011, 3011, 4011 boards are standalone representatives of the series or have more than 9 wired interfaces, so the name was simplified to full hundreds or development year.

### Board Features

Board features follow immediately after board name section (no spaces or dashes), except when board name is a word, then board features are separated by space.

Currently used features (listed in the order they are used):

U-USB P-power injection with a controller i-single port power injector without a controller A-more memory and (or) higher license level H-more powerful CPU G-Gigabit (may include "U","A","H", if not used with "L") L-Lite edition D-addition Disk for storage (SSD or M.2) S-SFP port (legacy usage-SwitchOS devices) e-PCIe interface extension card x<N> - where N is number of CPU cores ( x2, x16, x36, etc) R-MiniPCIe slot with both USB and PCIe lines M-M.2 slot with both USB and PCIe lines

### Built-in wireless details

If the board has built-in wireless, then all its features are represented in the following format:

<band><power_per_chain><protocol><number_of_chains>

band 6 - 6Ghz 5 - 5Ghz 2 - 2.4Ghz 52 - dual-band 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz

power per chain (not used) - "Normal" - <23dBm at 6Mbps 802.11a; <24dBm at 6Mbps 802.11g H - "High" - 23-24dBm at 6Mbps 802.11a; 24-27dBm at 6Mbps 802.11g HP - "High Power" - 25-26dBm 6Mbps 802.11a; 28-29dBm at 6Mbps 802.11g SHP - "Super High Power" - 27+dBm at 6Mbps 802.11a; 30+dBm at 6Mbps 802.11g

protocol (not used) - for cards with only 802.11a/b/g support n-for cards with 802.11n support ac-for cards with 802.11ac support ax-for cards with 802.11ax support be-for cards with 802.11be support bn-for interfaces with 802.11bn support

number_of_chains (not used) - single chain D-dual (2)chain T-triple (3)chain Q-quad (4) chain P-penta (5) chain H-hexa (6) chain S-septa (7) chain O-octa (8) chain N-nona (9) chain E - “ene” (10) chain (as D for "deca" is busy already)

connector type (not used) - only one connector option on the model MMCX-MMCX connector type

u.FL-u.FL connector type
### Enclosure type

(not used) - the main type of enclosure for a product BU-board unit (no enclosure) - for a situation when a board-only option is required, but the main product already comes in the case RM-rack-mount enclosure IN-indoor enclosure EM-extended memory LM-lite memory BE-black edition case TC-Tower (vertical) case PC-PassiveCooling enclosure (for CCR) TC-Tower (vertical) Case enclosure (for hEX, hAP and other home routers.) OUT-outdoor enclosure

More Specific types OUT enclosures are:

SA-sector antenna enclosure (for SXT) HG-high gain antenna enclosure (for SXT) BB-Basebox enclosure (for RB911) NB-NetBox enclosure (for RB911) NM-NetMetal enclosure (for RB911) QRT-QRT enclosure (for RB911) SX-Sextant enclosure (for RB911,RB711)

SXTsq-SXTsq enclosure PB-PowerBOX enclosure (for RB750P, RB950P) XL-extra large enclosure (bigger size LHG for example) LTm-LtAP mini case, LT-LtAP case KN-KNOT case
