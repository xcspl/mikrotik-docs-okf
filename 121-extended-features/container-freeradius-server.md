# Container-freeradius server

Introduction Summary Configuration Container mode Networking Getting image Starting the container Altering the server's configuration files Result verification

## Introduction

The introduction of the container feature into the RouterOS made it possible to run all kinds of servers for all sorts of tasks inside the router. This is especially relevant for people, who want to reduce the number of devices in their network. Instead of running a server on a separate device/machine, why not run it inside the router?

Radius is short for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. RouterOS has a RADIUS client feature supported that can authenticate for HotSpot, PPP P, PPoE PPTP L2TP, ,, and ISDN connections. Basically, this feature allows you to connect RouterOS to a Radius Server, and then, utilize the user database from the server for client authentication.

In our example, we will showcase freeradius/freeradius-server image installation.

## Summary

Sub-menu: /container

note: container package is required.

Make sure to study our container guide before proceeding with the configuration. Make sure to check the disclaimer and requirements sections to understand all the risks and necessary steps you might be required to do.

At the time, when the guide was published, the image was available for linux/amd64 OS/architecture only (usable by CHR and x86 devices). For arm64 devices you will need to make your own container from FreeRADIUS source. For both arm64 and arm32 devices, you can also use freeradius/freeradius- server-dev image at your own risk (as it is "experimental/development" version of the image).

To help you set up a CHR in a Virtual Box, please check our youtube tutorial, or Make your own x86 router.

This guide demonstrates a basic example! The tests were performed in a local environment! This guide is meant for basic RADIUS "testing" purposes! Not all "freeradius" features were tested!

## Configuration

### Container mode

Enable container mode:

/system/device-mode/update container=yes

You will need to confirm the device-mode with a cold reboot if using the container on X86.

Networking

Add veth interface for the container:

/interface/veth/add name=veth3 address=172.17.0.2/24 gateway=172.17.0.1

Create a bridge for the container, assign an IP network to it, and add veth to the bridge:

/interface/bridge/add name=dockerfreeradius /ip/address/add address=172.17.0.1/24 interface=dockerfreeradius /interface/bridge/port add bridge=dockerfreeradius interface=veth3

Setup NAT for outgoing traffic if required:

/ip/firewall/nat/add chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=172.17.0.0/24

### Getting image

To simplify the configuration, we will get the image from an external library but you can also import it via the .tar file.

Make sure that you have "Registry URL" set accordingly, limit RAM usage (if necessary), and set up a directory for the image:

/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=pull

Pull image with the help of the command:

/container/add remote-image=freeradius/freeradius-server:latest interface=veth3 root-dir=freeradius logging=yes cmd="-X"

where cmd="-X" enables debug logging (per the "freeradius" documentation).

After running the command, RouterOS should start "extracting" the package. Check "File System" for newly created folders and monitor container status with the command /container/print.

### Starting the container

After you make sure that the container has been added and the status changed to status=stopped after using /container/print → you can initiate it:

/container/start 0

### Altering the server's configuration files

To access the server's configuration files (clients.conf and authorize), we will need to use SFTP (file transfer over SSH) protocol, so make sure that SSH se rvice is enabled.

Open your command terminal ("CMD", as Administrator, for Windows users, or "Linux Shell or Command Terminal" for Linux users) and navigate it to the directory where you want to download the configuration files. For example, to "radius" folder on your "Desktop":

C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\radius

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\radius>

Initiate SFTP to the device's IP address:

C:\Users\DenissPC\Desktop\radius>sftp admin@10.55.8.53 admin@10.55.8.53's password: Connected to 10.55.8.53. sftp>

Go to the server's configuration file folder (use dir or ls command to see the content of the folder you are in and cd command to go to the folder of our choice).

The first file, "clients.conf" allows you to define RADIUS clients. Per the "freeradius" documentation, it should be under the "/etc/freeradius" directory...so, navigate there and use get command to download it:

sftp> dir freeradius pub pull skins sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius sftp> dir README.rst certs clients.conf dictionary experimental.conf hints huntgroups mods-available mods-config mods-enabled panic.gdb policy. d proxy.conf radiusd.conf sites-available sites-enabled templates.conf trigger. conf users sftp> get clients.conf Fetching /freeradius/etc/freeradius/clients.conf to clients.conf /freeradius/etc/freeradius/clients.conf 100% 8323 1.2MB/s 00:00

Open "clients.conf" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other). You can study the file to see all the options that you have (additionally, check freer adius.org). This example shows a basic setup, so, we will just overwrite the whole file with the lines shown below:

client new { ipaddr = 0.0.0.0/0 secret = client_password }

where we indicate, that our radius client can connect using any possible IP address (ipaddr=0.0.0.0/0 ensures that, but you also can change it to the actual ip address/mask of your radius client if you require to do so) and that our secret is "client_password" (you can change it to any other secret).

Save the file/overwrite it.

The second file, "authorize" allows you to set up users. Per the "freeradius" documentation, it should be under "/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files". Go there and get the file:

sftp> dir freeradius pub pull skins sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files sftp> dir accounting authorize dhcp pre-proxy sftp> get authorize Fetching /freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files/authorize to authorize /freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files/authorize 100% 6594 1.1MB/s 00:00

Open "authorize" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other). This example shows a basic setup, so, we will just uncomment (remove the "#" symbol from) the line shown below (leave the rest of the configuration/lines as they are):

bob Cleartext-Password := "hello"

which creates a username "bob" and sets the password to "hello" (you can change the username and password).

Save the file/overwrite it.

Upload both files back/overwrite the default files with the help of the put command:

sftp> dir freeradius pub pull skins sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius sftp> dir README.rst certs clients.conf dictionary experimental.conf hints huntgroups mods-available mods-config mods-enabled panic.gdb policy. d proxy.conf radiusd.conf sites-available sites-enabled templates.conf trigger. conf users sftp> put clients.conf Uploading clients.conf to /freeradius/etc/freeradius/clients.conf clients.conf 100% 67 22.3KB/s 00:00 sftp> cd mods-config/files sftp> dir accounting authorize dhcp pre-proxy sftp> put authorize Uploading authorize to /freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files/authorize authorize 100% 6626 1.6MB/s 00:00

Restart the container:

/container/stop 0 /container/start 0

Make sure to wait for the container to stop (status=stopped should be shown after using /container/print command) before initiating it again.

## Result verification

In RouterOS, add a new RADIUS client configuration:

/radius/add service=login address=172.17.0.2 secret="client_password"

,where the address is the IP address of the veth3 interface, secret is the secret that we configured in the clients.conf file and service is the allowed service that you wish to use.

Allow "login" with RADIUS users via the command:

/user/aaa/set use-radius=yes

We have allowed the "login" service for the RADIUS and we can test it using ssh/winbox/webfig connection. For SSH test, issue the command (where you need to indicate the device's management IP and input bob's password "hello" after):

/system/ssh 10.55.8.53 user=bob

You should be able to verify, that the terminal user changed from "admin@MikroTik" to "bob@MikroTik":

[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ssh 10.55.8.53 user=bob password: hello

MMM MMM KKK TTTTTTTTTTT KKK MMMM MMMM KKK TTTTTTTTTTT KKK MMM MMMM MMM III KKK KKK RRRRRR OOOOOO TTT III KKK KKK MMM MM MMM III KKKKK RRR RRR OOO OOO TTT III KKKKK MMM MMM III KKK KKK RRRRRR OOO OOO TTT III KKK KKK MMM MMM III KKK KKK RRR RRR OOOOOO TTT III KKK KKK

If you issue the command /user/active/print:

/user/active/print Flags: R-RADIUS Columns: WHEN, NAME, ADDRESS, VIA # WHEN NAME ADDRESS VIA 0 feb/16/2023 16:31:21 admin xx.xx.xx.xx winbox 1 feb/16/2023 16:38:46 admin xx.xx.xx.xx console 2 R feb/16/2023 16:38:53 bob 10.55.8.53 ssh

you will be able to verify, that a new user "bob" is "active" and has a flag "R" assigned, which indicates it is a RADIUS user.
