### Scripting language manual

This manual provides an introduction to RouterOS's built-in powerful scripting language.

Scripting host provides a way to automate some router maintenance tasks by means of executing user-defined scripts bounded to some event occurrence.

Scripts can be stored in Script repository or can be written directly to the console. The events used to trigger script execution include, but are not the limited to the System Scheduler, the Traffic Monitoring Tool, and the Netwatch Tool generated events.

If you are already familiar with scripting in RouterOS, you might want to see our Tips & Tricks.

Line structure

The RouterOS script is divided into a number of command lines. Command lines are executed one by one until the end of the script or until a runtime error occurs.

Command-line

The RouterOS console uses the following command syntax:

[prefix] [path] command [uparam] [param=[value]] .. [param=[value]]

[prefix] - ":" or "/" character which indicates if a command is ICE or path. It may not be required. [path] - relative path to the desired menu level. It may not be required. command-one of the commands available at the specified menu level. [uparam] - unnamed parameter, must be specified if the command requires it. [params] - a sequence of named parameters followed by respective values

The end of the command line is represented by the token “;” or NEWLINE. Sometimes “;” or NEWLINE is not required to end the command line.

Single command inside (), [] or {} does not require any end-of-command character. The end of the command is determined by the content of the whole script

:if ( true ) do={ :put "lala" }

Each command line inside another command line starts and ends with square brackets "[]" (command concatenation).

:put [/ip route get [find gateway=1.1.1.1]];

Notice that the code above contains three command lines:

:put /ip route get find gateway=1.1.1.1

Command-line can be constructed from more than one physical line by following line joining rules.

Physical Line

A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line (EOL) sequence. Any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be used:

Unix – ASCII LF; Windows – ASCII CR LF; mac – ASCII CR;

Standard C conventions for newline characters can be used ( the \n character).

Comments

The following rules apply to a comment:

A comment starts with a hash character (#) and ends at the end of the physical line. RouterOS does not support multiline comments. If a character appears inside the string it is not considered a comment. #

Example

# this is a comment # next line comment :global a; # another valid comment

:global myStr "part of the string # is not a comment"

Line joining

|Example|Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using the backslash character (\). The following rules apply to using backslash as a line-joining tool: A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment. A backslash does not continue a comment. A backslash does not continue a token except for string literals. A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a line outside a string literal.|
|---|---|
||:if ($a = true \ and $b=false) do={:put "$a $b";} :if ($a = true \ # bad comment and $b=false) do={:put "$a $b";} # comment \ continued-invalid (syntax error) Whitespace between tokens Whitespace can be used to separate tokens. Whitespace is necessary between two tokens only if their concatenation could be interpreted as a different token. Example:|
|{}|:local a true; :local b false; # whitespace is not required :put (a&&b); # whitespace is required :put (a and b);|
|Example:|Whitespace characters are not allowed between '<parameter>=' between 'from=' 'to=' 'step=' 'in=' 'do=' 'else=' #incorrect: :for i from = 1 to = 2 do = {:put $i} #correct syntax: :for i from=1 to=2 do={:put $i} :for i from= 1 to= 2 do={:put $i} #incorrect /ip route add gateway = 3.3.3.3 #correct /ip route add gateway=3.3.3.3|
|Scopes|Variables can be used only in certain regions of the script called scopes. These regions determine the visibility of the variable. There are two types of scopes-global and local. A variable declared within a block is accessible only within that block and blocks enclosed by it, and only after the point of declaration. Global scope Global scope or root scope is the default scope of the script. It is created automatically and can not be turned off. Previously set global variable can be used in scripts by declaring it without setting the value. Local scope|

User can define their own groups to block access to certain variables, these scopes are called local scopes. Each local scope is enclosed in curly braces ("{ }").

{ :local a 3; { :local b 4; :put ($a+$b); } #line below will show variable b in light red color since it is not defined in scope :put ($a+$b); }

In the code above variable, b has local scope and will not be accessible after a closing curly brace.

Each line written in the terminal is treated as local scope

So for example, the defined local variable will not be visible in the next command line and will generate a syntax error [admin@MikroTik] > :local myVar a; [admin@MikroTik] > :put $myVar syntax error (line 1 column 7)

Do not define global variables inside local scopes.

Note that even variable can be defined as global, it will be available only from its scope unless it is not referenced to be visible outside of the scope.

{ :local a 3; { :global b 4; } :put ($a+$b); }

The code above will output 3, because outside of the scope b is not visible.

The following code will fix the problem and will output 7:

{ :local a 3; { :global b 4; } :global b; :put ($a+$b); }

Keywords

The following words are keywords and cannot be used as variable and function names: and or in

Delimiters

The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar: () [] {} :; $ /

Data types

RouterOS scripting language has the following data types:

Type Description

num (number)- 64bit signed integer, possible hexadecimal input;

bool (boolean)- values can bee true or false;

str (string)- character sequence;

ip- IP address;

ip-prefix- IP prefix;

ip6- IPv6 address

ip6-prefix- IPv6 prefix

id (internal ID)- hexadecimal value prefixed by '*' sign. Each menu item has an assigned unique number-internal ID;

time- date and time value;

array- sequence of values organized in an array;

nil- default variable type if no value is assigned;

Constant Escape Sequences

Following escape sequences can be used to define certain special characters within a string:

\" Insert double quote

\\ Insert backslash

\n Insert newline

\r Insert carriage return

\t Insert horizontal tab

\$ Output $ character. Otherwise, $ is used to link the variable.

\? Output ? character. Otherwise ? is used to print "help" in the console. Removed since v7.1rc2

\_- space

\a- BEL (0x07)

\b- backspace (0x08)

\f- form feed (0xFF)

\v Insert vertical tab

\xx A print character from hex value. Hex numbers should use capital letters.

Example :put "\48\45\4C\4C\4F\r\nThis\r\nis\r\na\r\ntest";

which will show on the display HELLO This is a test

|Operators|Arithmetic Operators||Usual arithmetic operators are supported in the RouterOS scripting language|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operator|Description||Example|
|"+" "-" "*" "/" "%" "-"|binary addition binary subtraction binary division modulo operation unary negation Relational Operators|binary multiplication|:put (3+4); :put (1-6); :put (4*5); :put (10 / 2); :put ((10)/2) :put (5 % 3); {:local a 1; :put (-a);} Note: for the division to work you have to use braces or spaces around the dividend so it is not mistaken as an IP address|
|Operator|Description||Example|
|"<" ">" "=" "<=" ">=" "!="|less greater equal less or equal greater or equal not equal Logical Operators|/interface/print where (name~"ether")=false Or to do the opposite, you can use "expression=true": /interface/print where (name~"ether")=true|:put (3<4); :put (3>4); :put (2=2); To negate an expression, you can use "expression=false". To print all interfaces that are not "ethernet", you can use expression negation like this:|
|Operator|Description||Example|
|“!” “&&”, “and” “||”, “or” “in”|logical NOT logical AND logical OR Bitwise Operators||:put (!true); :put (true&&true) :put (true||false); :put (1.1.1.1/32 in 1.0.0.0/8); Bitwise operators are working only on IP, and IPv6 address data types.|
|Operator|Description||Example|
|{}|:local IP 192.168.88.77; :local CIDRnetmask 255.255.255.0; :put ($IP&$CIDRnetmask); Get the last 8 bits from the given IP addresses: :put (192.168.88.77&0.0.0.255); Use the "|" operator and inverted CIDR mask to calculate the broadcast address:|||
|{}|:local IP 192.168.88.77; :local Network 192.168.88.0; :local CIDRnetmask 255.255.255.0; :local InvertedCIDR (~$CIDRnetmask); :put ($Network|$InvertedCIDR) Concatenation Operators|||
|Operator|Description|Example||
|"." ","|concatenates two strings concatenates two arrays or adds an element to the array It is possible to add variable values to strings without a concatenation operator: :global myVar "world"; :put ("Hello ". $myVar); # next line does the same as above :put "Hello $myVar"; By using $[] and $() in the string it is possible to add expressions inside strings:|:put ({1;2;3}, 5);|:put ("concatenate". " ". "string");|

:local a 5; :local b 6; :put " 5x6 = $($a * $b)";

:put " We have $[ :len [/ip route find]] routes";

Other Operators

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|“[]”|command substitution. Can contain only a single command line|:put [ :len "my test string";];|
|“()”|subexpression or grouping operator|:put ( "value is ". (4+5));|
|“$”|substitution operator|:global a 5; :put $a;|
|“~”|the binary operator that matches value against POSIX extended regular expression|Print all routes whose gateway ends with 202: /ip route print where gateway~"^[0-9 \\.] *202\$"|
|“->”|Get an array element by key|[admin@x86] >:global aaa {a=1;b=2} [admin@x86] > :put ($aaa->"a")|
|||1 [admin@x86] > :put ($aaa->"b")|
|||2|

Variables

The scripting language has two types of variables:

global-accessible from all scripts created by the current user, defined by global keyword; local-accessible only within the current scope, defined by local keyword.

There can be undefined variables. When a variable is undefined, the parser will try to look for variables set, for example, by DHCP lease-script or Hotspot o n-login

Every variable, except for built-in RouterOS variables, must be declared before usage by local or global keywords. Undefined variables will be marked as undefined and will result in a compilation error. Example:

# following code will result in compilation error, because myVar is used without declaration :set myVar "my value"; :put $myVar

Correct code:

:local myVar; :set myVar "my value"; :put $myVar;

The exception is when using variables set, for example, by DHCP lease-script

/system script add name=myLeaseScript policy=\ ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,winbox,password,sniff,sensitive,api \ source=":log info \$leaseActIP\r\ \n:log info \$leaseActMAC\r\ \n:log info \$leaseServerName\r\ \n:log info \$leaseBound"

/ip dhcp-server set myServer lease-script=myLeaseScript

Valid characters in variable names are letters and digits. If the variable name contains any other character, then the variable name should be put in double quotes. Example:

#valid variable name :local myVar; #invalid variable name :local my-var; #valid because double quoted :global "my-var";

If a variable is initially defined without value then variable data type is set to nil, otherwise, a data type is determined automatically by the scripting the engine. Sometimes conversion from one data type to another is required. It can be achieved using data conversion commands. Example:

#convert string to array :local myStr "1,2,3,4,5"; :put [:typeof $myStr]; :local myArr [:toarray $myStr]; :put [:typeof $myArr]

Variable names are case-sensitive.

:local myVar "hello" # following line will generate error, because variable myVAr is not defined :put $myVAr # correct code :put $myVar

Set command without value will un-define the variable (remove from environment, new in v6.2)

#remove variable from environment :global myVar "myValue" :set myVar;

Use quotes on the full variable name when the name of the variable contains operators. Example:

:local "my-Var"; :set "my-Var" "my value"; :put $"my-Var";

Reserved variable names

All built-in RouterOS properties are reserved variables. Variables that will be defined the same as the RouterOS built-in properties can cause errors. To avoid such errors, use custom designations.

For example, the following script will not work:

{ :local type "ether1"; /interface print where name=$type; }

But will work with different defined variables:

{ :local customname "ether1"; /interface print where name=$customname; }

Commands

Global commands

|Every global command should start with||":" token, otherwise, it will be treated as a variable. the||

Menu specific commands

Common commands

The following commands are available from most sub-menus:

|Command|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|add|add <param>=<value>. .<param>=<value>|add new item|
|remove|remove <id>|remove selected item|
|enable|enable <id>|enable selected item|
|disable|disable <id>|disable selected item|
|set|set <id> <param>=<value>. .<param>=<value>|change selected items parameter, more than one parameter can be specified at the time. The parameter can be unset by specifying '!' before the parameter. Example: /ip firewall filter add chain=blah action=accept protocol=tcp port=123 nth=4,2|
|||print set 0 !port chain=blah2 !nth protocol=udp|
|get|get <id> <param>=<value>|get the selected item's parameter value|

|print export edit find import hand.|print <param><param>= [<value>] export [file=<value>] edit <id> <param> find <expression> Starting from 7.16.x version, its possible to catch syntax errors:|described here edit selected items property in the built-in text editor /interface find name~"ether"] The import command is available from the root menu and is used to import configuration from files created by|print menu items. Output depends on the print parameters specified. The most common print parameters are export configuration from the current menu and its sub-menus (if present). If the file parameter is specified output will be written to the file with the extension '.rsc', otherwise the output will be printed to the console. Exported commands can be imported by import command Returns list of internal numbers for items that are matched by given expression. For example:  :put [export command or written manually by an|
|---|---|---|---|
|Failure #line 1 this ... print parameters|New parameter onerror can be used: without changing the configuration. bad command name this (line 1 column 1) Several parameters are available for print command:|[admin@admin] > do {import test.rsc} on-error={:put "Failure"} [admin@admin] > onerror e in={import test.rsc} do={:put "Failure - $e"} Failure-Script Error: bad command name this (line 1 column 1) [admin@admin] > import test.rsc verbose=yes dry-run Script Error: found 5 error(s) in import file|In addition, the import command has new options in verbose mode-the dry-run parameter is specially designed for debugging and can find multiple errors|
|Parameter|Description||Example|
|append as-value brief detail count-only file follow follow-only|print brief description print output to a file when viewing log entries|print output as an array of parameters and its values print detailed description, the output is not as readable as brief output but may be useful to view all parameters print only count of menu items print all current entries and track new entries until ctrl-c is pressed, very useful when viewing log entries print and track only new entries until ctrl-c is pressed, very useful|:put [/ip address print as-value] /log print follow /log print follow-only|

timestamp parameter only usable with follow command to highlight the /ip arp print follow timestamp "time" when the change was made

on-event parameter only usable with follow command to be able to run /log print follow on-event={:log info "Someone scripts when new entries appear logged-in"} where message~"admin logged"

from print parameters only from specified item /user print from=admin

interval continuously print output in a selected time interval, useful to /interface print interval=2 track down changes where follow is not acceptable

terse show details in a compact and machine-friendly format

value-list show values single per line (good for parsing purposes)

without-If the output does not fit in the console screen then do not stop, paging print all information in one piece

where expressions followed by where parameters can be used to filter /ip route print where interface="ether1" outmatched entries

about returns entries that have the "about" parameter, such as /interface wifi print where about "managed by CAPsMAN "information or warnings

More than one parameter can be specified at a time, for example, /ip route print count-only interval=1 where interface="ether1"

do..while :do { <commands> } while=( <conditions> ); :while ( <conditions> ) execute commands until a given do={ <commands> }; condition is met.

for :for <var> from=<int> to=<int> step=<int> do={ <commands> } execute commands over a given number of iterations

foreach :foreach <var> in=<array> do={ <commands> }; execute commands for each element in a list

Conditional statement

Command Syntax Description

if :if (<condition>) do={<commands>} If a given condition is true then execute commands in the do block, otherwise else={<commands>} execute commands in the else block if specified.

Example:

{ :local myBool true; :if ($myBool = false) do={ :put "value is false" } else={ :put "value is true" } }

Functions

Scripting language does not allow you to create functions directly, however, you could use :parse command as a workaround.

Starting from v6.2 new syntax is added to easier define such functions and even pass parameters. It is also possible to return function value with :return co mmand.

See examples below:

#define function and run it :global myFunc do={:put "hello from function"} $myFunc

output: hello from function

#pass arguments to the function :global myFunc do={:put "arg a=$a"; :put "arg '1'=$1"} $myFunc a="this is arg a value" "this is arg1 value"

output: arg a=this is arg a value arg '1'=this is arg1 value

Notice that there are two ways how to pass arguments:

pass arg with a specific name ("a" in our example) pass value without arg name, in such case arg "1", "2" .. "n" is used.

Return example

:global myFunc do={ :return ($a + $b)} :put [$myFunc a=6 b=2]

output: 8

You can even clone an existing script from the script environment and use it as a function.

#add script /system script add name=myScript source=":put \"Hello \$myVar !\""

:global myFunc [:parse [/system script get myScript source]] $myFunc myVar=world

output: Hello world !

If the function contains a defined global variable that names match the name of the passed parameter, then the globally defined variable is ignored, for compatibility with scripts written for older versions. This feature can change in future versions. Avoid using parameters with the same name as global variables.

For example:

:global my2 "123"

:global myFunc do={ :global my2; :put $my2; :set my2 "lala"; :put $my2 } $myFunc my2=1234 :put "global value $my2"

The output will be: 1234 lala global value 123

Nested function example

Note: to call another function its name needs to be declared (the same as for variables)

:global funcA do={ :return 5 } :global funcB do={ :global funcA; :return ([$funcA] + 4) } :put [$funcB]

Output: 9

Catch run-time errors

Starting from v6.2 scripting has the ability to catch run-time errors.

For example, the [code]:reslove[/code] command if failed will throw an error and break the script. [admin@MikroTik] > { :put [:resolve www.example.com]; :put "lala";} failure: dns name does not exist

Now we want to catch this error and proceed with our script:

:onerror e {:put [:resolve www.example.com]} do={:put "resolver failed"} :put "lalala"

output:

resolver failed lala

Operations with Arrays

Warning: Key name in the array contains any character other than a lowercase character, it should be put in quotes

For example:

[admin@ce0] > {:local a { "aX"=1; ay=2 }; :put ($a->"aX")} 1

Loop through keys and values

"foreach" command can be used to loop through keys and elements:

[admin@ce0] > :foreach k,v in={2; "aX"=1; y=2; 5} do={:put ("$k=$v")}

0=2 1=5 aX=1 y=2

If the "foreach" command is used with one argument, then the element value will be returned:

[admin@ce0] > :foreach v in={2; "aX"=1; y=2; 5} do={:put ("$v")}

2 5 1 2

Note: If the array element has a key then these elements are sorted in alphabetical order, elements without keys are moved before elements with keys and

their order is not changed (see example above).

Change the value of a single array element [admin@MikroTik] > :global a {x=1; y=2} [admin@MikroTik] > :set ($a->"x") 5 [admin@MikroTik] > :environment print a={x=5; y=2}

### Script repository

Sub-menu level: /system script

Contains all user-created scripts. Scripts can be executed in several different ways:

on event-scripts are executed automatically on some facility events ( scheduler, netwatch, VRRP) by another script-running script within the script is allowed manually - from console executing a run command or in winbox

Only scripts (including schedulers, netwatch, etc) with equal or higher permission rights can execute other scripts.

When executing script from GUI or CLI, user permissions are used. To run a script with script permissions, a script must be executed from CLI with additional "use-script-permissions" parameter.

Property Description

comment (string; Default: ) Descriptive comment for the script

dont-require-permissions (yes | no; Default: no) Bypass permissions check when the script is being executed, useful when scripts are being executed from services that have limited permissions, such as Netwatch

name (string; Default: "Script[num]") name of the script

policy (string; Default: ftp,reboot,read,write,policy, list of applicable policies: test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon) ftp-can log on remotely via FTP and send and retrieve files from the router password-change passwords policy-manage user policies, add and remove user read-can retrieve the configuration reboot-can reboot the router sensitive-allows changing "hide sensitive" parameter sniff-can run sniffer, torch, etc test-can run ping, traceroute, bandwidth test write-can change the configuration

Read more detailed policy descriptions here

source (string;) Script source code

Read-only status properties:

Property Description

last-started (date) Date and time when the script was last invoked.

owner (string) The user who created the script

run-count (integer) Counter that counts how many times the script has been executed

Menu specific commands

Command Description

run (run [id|name]) Execute the specified script by ID or name using user permissions.

use-script-permissions Additional parameter to execute script using script permissions.

Environment

Sub-menu level:

/system script environment /environment

Contains all user-defined variables and their assigned values. [admin@MikroTik] > :global example; [admin@MikroTik] > :set example 123 [admin@MikroTik] > /environment print "example"=123

Read-only status properties:

Property Description

name (string) Variable name

user (string) The user who defined variable

value () The value assigned to a variable

Job

Sub-menu level: /system script job

Contains a list of all currently running scripts. Read-only status properties:

Property Description

owner (string) The user who is running the script

policy (array) List of all policies applied to the script

started (date) Local date and time when the script was started

### Script permissions

There are four ways a script can be run: using script permissions, user permissions, scheduler permissions or on-event permissions (such as /system routerboard mode-button settings).

Depending on how a script is called, it may inherit different permissions or use its own.

When using /system script run, a script can inherit the permissions of the caller.

In this example, we use an admin user with full permissions and test running a script both with and without the use-script-permissions parameter.

/system script add dont-require-permissions=no name=add-dhcp-no-perms owner=admin policy="" sour ce="/ip dhcp-client add interface=ether2; put \"Added DHCP client ether2!\""

/user/print Columns: NAME, GROUP, LAST-LOGGED-IN, INACTIVITY-POLICY # NAME GROUP LAST-LOGGED-IN INACTIVITY-POLICY ;;; system default user 0 admin full 2025-07-22 17:09:59 none

[admin@MikroTik] > system/script/run add-dhcp-no-perms use-script-permissions not enough permissions (9) [admin@MikroTik] > system/script/run add-dhcp-no-perms Added DHCP client on ether2!

Similarly, there are multiple ways to run a script using the scheduler tool. When using the scheduler, the script can run with the scheduler's permissions.

You can also call the script by name using the scheduler, which works the same way as /system script run use-script-permissions.

To demonstrate this, we create three schedulers, each configured to run the script in a different way:

/system scheduler add interval=10s name=run-script-use-script-perms on-event="/system script run add-dhcp-no-perms use-script- permissions" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon add interval=10s name=run-script-direct on-event=add-dhcp-no-perms policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test, password,sniff,sensitive,romon add interval=10s name=run-script-scheduler-perms on-event="/system script run add-dhcp-no-perms" policy=ftp, reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon

After these schedulers run, the logs show that the two methods using use-script-permissions or calling the script by name fail due to insufficient permissions.

In contrast, run-script-scheduler-perms executes the script successfully, as it inherits the scheduler's permissions.

/log print 2025-07-22 18:11:25 script,error executing script add-dhcp-no-perms from scheduler (run-script-direct) failed, please check it manually 2025-07-22 18:11:25 script,error,debug not enough permissions (9) (/ip/dhcp-client/add; line 1) 2025-07-22 18:11:25 script,error executing script from scheduler (run-script-use-script-perms) failed, please check it manually 2025-07-22 18:11:25 script,error,debug (scheduler:run-script-use-script-perms) not enough permissions (9) (/ip /dhcp-client/add; line 1) 2025-07-22 18:11:25 system,info dhcp client added by scheduler:run-script-scheduler-perms/script:add-dhcp-no- perms (*7 = /ip dhcp-client add interface=ether2)

A script with higher or more permissions than the user/scheduler cannot be run; use-script-permissions won’t override this.
