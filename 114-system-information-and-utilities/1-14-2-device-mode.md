## Description

The device-mode is a feature which sets specific limitations on a device, or limits access to specific configuration options. It helps to protect your router and network from attackers who might gain unauthorized  and use it as a gateway for attacks to other networks.

Available device-mode are advanced, home, basic and rose. Device-mode configuration is factory pre-installed to routers (for devices with MikroTik RouterOS v7.17 or later). Advanced (previously called enterprise) mode is configured to CCR and 1100 series devices, home mode is configured to home routers and basic mode to any other type of device. For devices running versions prior to RouterOS version 7.17, all devices use the advanced/enterprise mode.

[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print mode: advanced allowed-versions: 7.13+,6.49.8+ flagged: no flagging-enabled: yes scheduler: yes socks: yes fetch: yes pptp: yes l2tp: yes bandwidth-test: yes traffic-gen: no sniffer: yes ipsec: yes romon: yes proxy: yes hotspot: yes smb: yes email: yes zerotier: yes container: no install-any-version: no partitions: no routerboard: yes attempt-count: 0

The device-mode can be changed by the authorized RouterOS user, but physical access to the device required to change it. After changing the device- mode, you need to confirm it, by pressing a button on the device itself, or perform a "cold reboot" - that is, unplug the power. When the change is confirmed, regardless of confirmation mode, the device will be rebooted!

## Changing mode of device-mode

[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home update: please activate by turning power off or pressing reset or mode button in 5m00s -- [Q quit|D dump|C-z pause]

If no power off or button press is performed within the specified time, the mode change is canceled. If another update command is run in parallel, both will be canceled.

There are several EOL products which do not "confirm" mode changes with a reset button press. These routers can confirm mode change only with a power cycle.

In order to protect device against attacker who might silently gain access to your router, abuse it with some scripts and simply try to wait until you will reboot your router and not even know that at that time you are accepting changes requested by some intruder, you can "update" mode only three times. There is a counter which will count how many update attempts are made and will not allow any more updates. This counter can be reset only when administrator does power-cycle the router or press a button when seeing such a warning on mode settings update attempt (same as with accepting any updates).

## Changing device-mode settings using Netinstall or FlashFig

Starting from RouterOS 7.22, it is possible to configure device‑mode and protected‑routerboot and other settings.

For more information, see the Netinstall and FlashFig documentation.

## Enabling device-mode feature

[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update container=yes update: too many unsuccessful attempts, turn off power or reboot by pressing reset or mode button in 4m55s to reset attempt-count

The following commands are available in the /system/device-mode menu:

Property Description

get Returns value that you can assign to variable or print on the screen.

print Shows the active mode and its properties.

update Applies changes to the specified properties, see below.

## Available device-mode modes

There are four device modes available for configuration (mode=advanced is default one), each mode has a subset of features that are not allowed when it is used. Note that <u>there is no mode, which has all features enabled</u>. Certain features need to be enabled even if you have "advanced" mode enabled. ROSE device-mode is very similar to advanced mode, but it is made for RDS and similar devices with wider option to use disks, therefore to support container installations from the factory. See section "Feature clarification" for more details about what each option means. So, as per the below table it can be seen that "traffic-gen, container, partitions, routerboard" features are always disabled, unless specifically enabled by the admin user.

Feature / Property Home Basic Advanced ROSE Bandwidth Test (/tool bandwidth-test) Containers (/container) Email (/tool e-mail) Fetch (/tool fetch) Hotspot (/ip hotspot) Install Any Version (install-any-version) IPsec (/ip ipsec) L2TP (/interface l2tp) Partitions (/partitions)

flagging-enabled (yes | no; Default: yes)

flagged (yes | no; Default: no)

The reset button or power off activation timeout can be set in range 00:00:10 .. 1d00:00:00. If the reset button is not pressed (or cold reboot is not performed) during this interval, the update will be canceled.

Device will perform configuration analysis and if traces of suspicious code are found, flagged mode will be triggered, setting flagged=yes, enabling restrictions described in the flagged=yes. See the See the "Flagged status" paragraph.

RouterOS employs various mechanisms to detect tampering with it's system files. If the system has detected unauthorized access to RouterOS, the status "flagged" is set to yes. If "flagged" is set to yes, for your safety, certain limitations are put in place. See below chapter for more information.

Allows choosing from available modes that will limit device functionality.

By default, advanced mode allows options except traffic-gen, container, partitions, install- any-version, routerboard. So to use these features, you will need to turn it on by performing a device-mode update.

By default, home mode disables the following features: scheduler, socks, fetch, bandwidth- test, traffic-gen, sniffer, romon, proxy, hotspot, email, zerotier, container, install-any-version, partitions, routerboard.

device to push the button or cut the power.

Advanced example of changing device-mode

More specific control over the available features is possible. Each of the features controlled by device-mode can be specifically turned on or off.

For instance scheduler won't allow to perform any action at system scheduler. Used device-mode disables all listed features, for instance  mode=home is used, but zerotier is required for your setup, device-mode update /system device-mode update zerotier=yes will be required with the physical access to

[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home email=yes [admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=advanced zerotier=no

If the update command specifies any of the mode parameters, this update replaces the entire device-mode configuration. In this case, all "per-feature" settings will be lost, except those specified with this command. For instance:

|mode: home fetch: yes email: yes -- reboot -- sniffer: no|[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home email=yes fetch=yes [admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config [admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=advanced sniffer=no [admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config mode: advanced|

## Allowed versions

Device mode lists in its parameters an argument called " ". This is a list of versions which MikroTik considers as secure and which ones do allowed-versions not include any serious vulnerabilities which could be used by an attacker.

This setting does not depend on the installed RouterOS version and works as a separate protection layer, in order to disallow attacker to downgrade version step-by-step to reach any known vulnerable RouterOS release. When you upgrade RouterOS to a release where a newer "allowed-versions" list is available, oldest list will be overwritten. If you downgrade RouterOS, "allowed-versions" list will not change and will remain updated to the latest list. The list is ignored, if device-mode "install-any-version" is enabled.

## Flagged status

Along with the device-mode feature, RouterOS now can analyze the whole configuration at system startup, to determine if there are any signs of unauthorized access to your router. If suspicious configuration is detected, the suspicious configuration will be disabled and the flagged parameter will be set to "yes". The device has now a Flagged state and enforces certain limitations.

[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print mode: advanced flagged: yes ...

If the system has this flagged status, the current configuration works, but it is not possible to perform the following actions:

bandwidth-test, traffic-generator, sniffer, as well as configuration actions that enable or create new configuration entries (it will still be possible to disable or delete them) for the following programs: system scheduler, SOCKS proxy, pptp, l2tp, ipsec, proxy, smb.

When performing the aforementioned actions while the router has the flagged state, you will receive an error message:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool sniffer/quick failure: configuration flagged, check all router configuration for unauthorized changes and update device-mode [admin@MikroTik] > /int l2tp-client/add connect-to=1.1.1.1 user=user failure: configuration flagged, check all router configuration for unauthorized changes and update device-mode

To exit the flagged state, you must perform the command "/system/device-mode/update flagged=no". The system will ask to either press a button, or issue a hard reboot (cut power physically or do a hard reboot of the virtual machine).

Important! Although the system has disabled any malicious looking rules, which triggered the flagged state, it is crucial to inspect all of your configuration for other unknown things, before exiting the flagged state. If your system has been flagged, assume that your system has been compromised and do a full audit of all settings before re-enabling the system for use. After completing the audit, change all the system passwords and upgrade to the latest RouterOS version.

Starting from RouterOS version 7.17 device-mode restricts SwOS/RouterOS transition for dual-boot; in order to enable: system/device-mode /update routerboard=yes
