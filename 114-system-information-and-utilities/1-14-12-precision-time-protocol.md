# Precision Time Protocol

Summary General Properties Configuration Create a PTP Profile Assign Ports to the PTP Profile PTP on VLAN Ports PTP with IGMP Snooping Monitoring Monitor Properties Supported Devices

## Summary

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), is a protocol used to synchronize clocks across a local area network. It is essential in industries and applications where precise timing is critical, such as telecommunications, finance, and industrial automation. PTP typically ensures time accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, but nanosecond-level accuracy is also achievable when hardware requirements are met. MikroTik’s implementation of PTP supports IEEE 1588-2008 (PTPv2) and includes hardware timestamping capabilities that ensure synchronization within the nanosecond range. For additional details on MikroTik’s PTP features, please refer to the list below.

## Supported Features:

Two-step Ordinary Clock and Boundary Clock. Hardware timestamping, ensuring clock syncronization in nanosecond(ns) range. IPv4 and Layer 2 (L2) multicast transport modes. End-to-End (E2E) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) delay mechanisms. IEEE 1588-2008 (PTPv2). Profile Support for:

802.1AS: Timing and synchronization for Audio Video Bridging (AVB) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), based on IEEE 802.1AS-
2020. AES67: High-performance audio-over-IP interoperability.
G.8275.1: Frequency and phase synchronization in PTP-aware networks. SMPTE: Audio/video synchronization in professional broadcast environments.
Mikrotik PTP support is hardware-dependent, please refer to the list of supported devices.

## Configuration

Configuring Precision Time Protocol (PTP) on MikroTik devices is a straightforward process. The primary steps involve creating a PTP profile and assigning the relevant ports to this profile for PTP operation.

Create a PTP Profile

To create a PTP profile, use the following command. In this example, we use the 802.1as profile, but you can select from other available profiles as needed:

/system ptp add name=ptp1 profile=802.1as

To verify that the profile has been created successfully, execute:

/system ptp print

The output will display the created profile with its current settings:

Flags: I-inactive, X-disabled 0 name="ptp1" priority1=auto priority2=auto delay-mode=auto transport=auto profile=802.1as domain=auto

By default, parameters for each profile are configured to "auto," which automatically selects the appropriate values based on the profile chosen. Before making manual adjustments, verify that the settings conform to relevant standards (e.g., ITU-T G.8275.1, IEEE 802.1as, SMPTE, AES67).

Assign Ports to the PTP Profile

As the final step, assign the ports that will participate in PTP. For example, lets include few sfp28 interfaces.  SFP28-12 is connected to the grandmaster clock, while SFP28-1 and SFP28-2 are connected to an ordinary clock/slave:

/system ptp port add interface=sfp28-1 ptp=ptp1 /system ptp port add interface=sfp28-2 ptp=ptp1 /system ptp port add interface=sfp28-12 ptp=ptp1

PTP on VLAN Ports

When PTP ports are also part of VLANs on your boundary clock device, you must add a bridge interface as an untagged port in the Bridge VLAN Table for every entry that includes a PTP port.

This is necessary because the bridge interface functions as a bridge port towards the CPU. Therefore, it must be included in the VLAN table along with the PTP ports ensuring that packets can be correctly received from the physical port and forwarded to the CPU via the bridge. Let's continue with our previous configuration to make this clearer:

# Create a new bridge interface /interface/bridge/add name=bridge1

# Assign the ports that will be part of this bridge /interface/bridge/port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp28-1 pvid=10 /interface/bridge/port add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp28-2 pvid=20

# Create new entries for Bridge VLAN Table /interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=10 untagged=bridge1,sfp28-1 /interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=20 untagged=bridge1,sfp28-2

This applies to the IPv4 and L2-forwardable (01-1B-19-00-00-00) transport modes. The only exception is L2-non-forwardable (01-80-C2-00-00- 0E), in which case there is no need to add a bridge interface as an untagged port in the Bridge VLAN Table.

To check the default(auto) transport mode values for each profile, please refer to the "General Properties"  section.

PTP with IGMP Snooping

If IGMP snooping is enabled on your bridge and VLANs are configured as shown in the previous example, you must manually add static Multicast Database (MDB) entries for each VLAN containing PTP ports that use IPv4 (224.0.1.129) as their transport modes. This ensures proper forwarding of PTP multicast traffic.

/interface bridge/mdb add group=224.0.1.129 bridge=bridge1 ports=bridge1 vid=10 /interface bridge/mdb add group=224.0.1.129 bridge=bridge1 ports=bridge1 vid=20

Static MDB entries in PTP setup are only required when IGMP snooping is enabled alongside VLANs.

## Monitoring

To monitor the status and performance of the PTP profile, use the following command:

/system ptp monitor 0

The output will provide detailed information about the profile's operational status:

name: ptp1 clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AD:C7 priority1: 246 priority2: 248 i-am-gm: no gm-clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AE:C3 gm-priority1: 100 gm-priority2: 248 master-clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AE:C3 slave-port: ether1 freq-drift: 2690 ppb offset: 3 ns hw-offset: -889419842 ns slave-port-delay: 306 ns

This information includes critical details such as the clock IDs, priority values, and timing offsets, which are essential for monitoring the accuracy and synchronization of your PTP setup.
