# Partitions

## Summary

Partitioning is supported on ARM, ARM64, MIPS, TILE, and PowerPC RouterBOARD devices that use NAND flash.

RouterOS allows repartitioning of NAND flash, enabling:

Separate RouterOS installations on each partition. The ability to specify primary and fallback partitions.

If one partition fails to boot (due to a failed upgrade, configuration issue, or software error), the next partition will automatically boot, providing a fallback. This feature acts as an interactive backup, allowing you to keep a verified, working installation and perform upgrades only on a secondary partition.

Once you've confirmed the new configuration is stable, you can use the "Save Config To" function to copy it to the other partitions.

Repartitioning of the NAND requires the latest bootloader version

Requirements and Limits:

Starting from RouterOS 7.20beta2, the minimum storage size for repartitioning is 128 MiB. Minimum RouterOS partition size during repartitioning: 60MiB. The maximum number of allowed partitions is 8.

For devices where the Partitions menu is supposed to be hidden, but were previously repartitioned:

It will be possible to repartition into a single partition.

The Partitions menu will then be hidden after reboot.

Example:

For a device with 128 MiB NAND, that previously had 4*32 MiB partitions, where RouterOS fits within 32 MiB, the behavior after upgrading, starting from RouterOS 7.20beta2, will be as follows:

It will continue using all 4 partitions with full partitioning options, as before repartitioning. In case of repartitioning, the only available options will be 1*128MiB or 2*64MiB partitions, and full partitioning features will remain available.

Starting from RouterOS version 7.17, you need to update the device-mode to use the partitions.

## Commands

Property Description

activate (<partition>) Assigns another partition as Active. This option is available if the "partitions" setting is enabled in device mode (since RouterOS 7.17).

repartition (integer) Will reboot the router and reformat the NAND, leaving only active partition.

copy-to (<partition>) Clone running OS with the config to specified partition. Previously stored data on the partition will be erased.

save-config-to (<partition>) Clone running-config on a specified partition. Everything else is untouched.
