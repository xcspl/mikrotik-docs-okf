# SOCKS

Introduction Property Description Access List Active Connections Example Application Examples

## Introduction

SOCKS (Socket Secure) is a proxy server that allows TCP-based application data to relay across the firewall, even if the firewall would block the packets. The SOCKS protocol is independent of application protocols, so it can be used for many services, e.g, WWW, FTP, TELNET, and others.

At first, an application client connects to the SOCKS proxy server, then the proxy server looks in its access list to see whether the client is permitted to access the remote application resource or not, if it is permitted, the proxy server relies on the packet to the application server and creates a connection between the application server and client.

Remember to configure your application client to use SOCKS!.

You should secure the SOCKS proxy using its access list and/or firewall to disallow access from outside. Failing to secure the proxy server may introduce security issues to your network, and may provide a way for spammers to send junk mail through the router.

### Property Description

Property Description

|connection-idle-timeout (time; default: 2m)|time after which idle connections are terminated|
|---|---|
|enabled (yes | no; default: no)|whether to enable or no the SOCKS proxy|
|max-connections (integer: 1..500; default: 200)|maxumum number of simultaneous connections|
|port (integer: 1..65535; default: 1080)|TCP port on which the SOCKS server listens for connections|

## Access List

/ip socks access

In the SOCKS access list, you can add rules which will control access to the SOCKS server. This list is similar to firewall lists.

Property Description

action (allow | deny; default: allow) allow-allow packets, matching this rule, to be forwarded for further processing

deny-deny access for packets, matching this rule

dst-address (IP address/netmask) destination (server's) address

dst-port (port) destination TCP port

src-address (IP address/netmask) source (client's) address for a packet

src-port (port) source TCP port

## Active Connections

The Active Connection list shows all established TCP connections, which are maintained through the SOCKS proxy server.

|Application Examples FTP service through SOCKS server IP address 192.168.0.2/24. We have already masqueraded our local network:|Let us consider that we have a network 192.168.0.0/24 which is masqueraded, using a router with a public IP 10.1.0.104/24 and a private IP 192.168.0.1 /24. Somewhere in the network is an FTP server with IP address 10.5.8.8. We want to allow access to this FTP server for a client in our local network with|
|[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat> print [admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat>|Flags: X-disabled, I-invalid, D-dynamic 0 chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=192.168.0.0/24|
|And access to public FTP servers is denied in the firewall:||
|[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall filter>|[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall filter> print Flags: X-disabled, I-invalid, D-dynamic 0 chain=forward action=drop src-address=192.168.0.0/24 dst-port=21 protocol=tcp|

We have to enable the SOCKS server:

[admin@MikroTik] ip socks> set enabled=yes [admin@MikroTik] ip socks> print enabled: yes port: 1080 connection-idle-timeout: 2m max-connections: 200 [admin@MikroTik] ip socks>

Add access to a client with an IP address 192.168.0.2/32 to SOCKS access list, allow data transfer from FTP server to client (allow destination ports from 1024 to 65535 for any IP address), and drop everything else:

[admin@MikroTik] ip socks access> add src-address=192.168.0.2 dst-port=21 \ \... action=allow [admin@MikroTik] ip socks access> add dst-port=1024-65535 action=allow [admin@MikroTik] ip socks access> add action=deny [admin@MikroTik] ip socks access> print Flags: X-disabled 0 src-address=192.168.0.2 dst-port=21 action=allow 1 dst-port=1024-65535 action=allow 2 action=deny [admin@MikroTik] ip socks access>

That's all-the SOCKS server is configured. To see active connections and data transmitted and received:

[admin@MikroTik] ip socks connections> print # SRC-ADDRESS DST-ADDRESS TX RX 0 192.168.0.2:1238 10.5.8.8:21 1163 4625 1 192.168.0.2:1258 10.5.8.8:3423 0 3231744 [admin@MikroTik] ip socks connections>

In order to use the SOCKS proxy server, you have to specify its IP address and port in your FTP client. In this case, IP address would be

192.168.0.1 (local IP address of the router/SOCKS server) and TCP port 1080.
