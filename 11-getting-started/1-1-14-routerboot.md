# RouterBOOT

Main and Backup loaders RouterBOARD reset button Configuration Reset For Wireless Wire kits Configuration Simple Upgrade Checking RouterBOOT version

RouterBOOT is responsible for starting RouterOS in RouterBOARD devices.

## Main and Backup loaders

By default, the main (regular) loader is used, but RouterBOARD devices also have a secondary (backup) bootloader, which can be used in case the main doesn't work. It is possible to call the backup loader with a configuration setting in RouterOS:

system/routerboard/settings/set force-backup-booter=yes

It is also possible to use the backup booter by turning on the device, with the RESET button pushed. It is only possible to upgrade the main RouterBOOT, so in case of failure, you can use the backup booter to start the device and downgrade the main loader. For upgrade instructions, follow the separate instructions in RouterBOARD#UpgradingRouterBOOT

### RouterBOARD reset button

RouterBOOT reset button has three functions:

Hold this button during boot time until the LED light starts flashing, and release the button to reset the RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds) Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAPs mode (total 10 seconds) Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until the LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers

If you hold the button before applying power, backup RouterBOOT will be used in addition to all the above actions. To do the above actions without loading the backup loader, push the button right after applying power to the device.

### Configuration Reset For Wireless Wire kits

The reset button has the same functionality as on other devices, explained in detail [https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Reset+Button](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Reset+Button)

5-second button hold on startup (USR LED light starts flashing) - resets to password-protected state.

10-second button hold on startup (USR LED turns solid after flashing) - completely removes configuration.

Configuration

For RouterBOARD devices that feature a serial console connector, it is possible to access the RouterBOOT loader configuration menu. The required cable is described in the Serial Console manual. RouterBOARD serial port is configured to 115200bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. We suggest disabling the hardware flow control.

This example shows the menu which is available in RouterBOOT 7.4beta4:

### Simple Upgrade

RouterBOOT can be upgraded from RouterOS by:

Run command /system routerboard upgrade Reboot your router to apply the upgrade (/system reboot)]

[admin@admin] > system/routerboard/upgrade Do you really want to upgrade firmware? [y/n]

Every ROS version has a new RouterBoot version included in it, once you perform a ROS upgrade we always recommend upgrading RouterBoot also.

### Checking RouterBOOT version

This command shows the current RouterBOOT version of your device and the available upgrade which is i ncluded in routeros-x.yy.npk package, or if you uploaded a *.FWF file corresponding to the device model:

[admin@admin] > system/routerboard/print ;;; Firmware upgraded successfully, please reboot for changes to take effect! routerboard: yes board-name: hAP ac model: RouterBOARD 962UiGS-5HacT2HnT serial-number: 6737057562DD firmware-type: qca9550L factory-firmware: 3.29 current-firmware: 6.49.5 upgrade-firmware: 7.4beta5

In this case, you see, there is a newer version of the Bootloader firmware available already inside your current RouterOS version and it has been updated and requires a reboot.

A downgrade is also possible by uploading *.FWF file with an older version may be required for troubleshooting purposes when contacting MikroTik support.
