Hardware Support

MikroTik made devices: RouterOS is  compatible with MikroTik hardware it comes preinstalled on. Even MikroTik devices that are no longer manufactured, can run the latest RouterOS versions and will receive software updates. There are a few exceptions to this for the very oldest product lines. The latest RouterOS v7 is not compatible with all MIPS-LE family of devices (such as RB100, series, some RB700 series devices etc. please check the architecture of the device in question). In short, there is no set limit on software compatibility or upgrades. Even devices that are no longer manufactured for 20 years, will still receive software updates, as long as they have enough RAM and are not based on a MIPS-LE CPU.

3rd party devices: RouterOS can also be run on 3rd party devices if they meet the following requirements:

x86 or AMPERE powered ARM CPU Minimum 64MB of RAM IDE, SATA, USB, and flash storage medium with a minimum of 64MB of space Network cards supported by Linux kernel

Note: NVMe storage is supported only for CHR, x86, Tile, and MMIPS architecture. For specific information, please look at each product

brochure or block diagram.

Note: RouterOS 7 with default configuration requires at least 32MB of RAM, but for more advanced configuration, we suggest at least 64MB.

Installation

Netinstall: Full network-based installation from PXE or EtherBoot enabled network card CHR: RouterOS version intended for running as a virtual machine CD-based installation

Configuration

MAC-based access for initial configuration WinBox – standalone Windows GUI configuration tool WebFig-advanced web-based configuration interface MikroTik-Android and iOS-based configuration tool Powerful command-line configuration interface with integrated scripting capabilities, accessible via local terminal, serial console, telnet and ssh API-the way to create your own configuration and monitoring applications

Backup/Restore

Binary configuration backup saving and loading Configuration export and import in human-readable text format

Firewall

Stateful filtering

Source and destination NAT

NAT helpers (h323, pptp, quake3, sip, ftp, irc, tftp) Internal connection, routing and packet marks Filtering by IP address and address range, port and port range, IP protocol, DSCP and many more Address lists Custom Layer7 matcher IPv6 support PCC-per connection classifier, used in load balancing configurations RAW filtering to bypass connection tracking.

Routing

Static routing Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) Policy based routing Interface routing ECMP routing IPv4 dynamic routing protocols: RIP v1/v2, OSPFv2, BGP v4 IPv6 dynamic routing protocols: RIPng, OSPFv3, BGP Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)

MPLS

Dynamic DNS update tool NTP client/server and synchronization with GPS system VRRP v2 and v3 support SNMP M3P-MikroTik Packet packer protocol for wireless links and ethernet MNDP-MikroTik neighbor discovery protocol, supports CDP (Cisco discovery protocol) RADIUS authentication and accounting TFTP server Synchronous interface support (Farsync cards only) (Removed in v5.x) Asynchronous – serial PPP dial-in/dial-out, dial on demand ISDN – dial-in/dial-out, 128K bundle support, Cisco HDLC, x75i, x75ui, x75bui line protocols, dial on demand

Kernel version

RouterOS version 6.x uses 3.3.5 RouterOS version 7.x uses 5.6.3

Supported Encryptions

RouterOS 7 is used for the management of network (telecommunication) devices.

RouterOS 7 includes encryption features (components), intended for data (information) security, passed through telecommunication channels and device control channels. All encryption features (components) are an integral part of RouterOS 7 and can not be changed by the end-users. RouterOS 7 is intended for installation by end-users without significant support from the vendor. RouterOS 7 uses the following security protocols:

|Supported security protocol|Encryption algorithm|Maximum key length|
