## Summary

RoMON stands for "Router Management Overlay Network". RoMON works by establishing an independent MAC layer peer discovery and data forwarding network. RoMON packets are encapsulated with EtherType 0x88bf and DST-MAC 01:80:c2:00:88:bf and its network operate independently of L2 or L3 forwarding configuration. When RoMON is enabled, any received RoMON packets will not be displayed by sniffer or torch tools.

Each router on the RoMON network is assigned its RoMON ID. RoMON ID can be selected from the port MAC address or specified by the user.

RoMON protocol does not provide encryption services. Encryption is provided at the "application" level, by e.g. using ssh or by using a secure WinBox.

RoMON packets can be forwarded through network switches or bridges, unless there are specific restrictions on multicast traffic. When using a MikroTik bridge with hardware offloading, these packets are treated like regular multicast packets and are flooded across the network.

Since RouterOS v7.17, if the RoMON service is enabled and the switch chip supports ACL rules, dynamic rules are automatically created to redirect these packets to the CPU, where the RoMON service operates. However, if the switch does not support ACL rules and configuration does not align, such as when CPU and RoMON untagged packets are not in the same VLAN, the RoMON service might not function as expected.

RB5009 (switch‑chip88E6393X) does not support this path. The chip’s frame‑types=admit‑only‑vlan‑tagged filter drops RoMON frames before any ACL rule can be applied, so the packets never reach the CPU.

## Configuration

In order for a device to participate in RoMON network, RoMON feature must be enabled and ports that participate in RoMON network must be specified.

Sub-menu: /tool/romon

Property Description

enabled (yes | no; Default: no) Disable or enable RoMON feature.

id (MAC address; Default: 00:00:00:00:00:00) MAC address to use as ID of this router.

secrets (string; Default: ) sensitive List of global secrets used for RoMON message hashing.

When RoMON is enabled without specifying ID, the ID is automatically selected:

[admin@MikroTik] /tool/romon> print enabled: yes id: 00:00:00:00:00:00 secrets: current-id: DC:2C:6E:9E:11:27

Ports that participate in RoMON network are configured in /tool/romon/port menu. Port list is a list of entries that match either a specific interface or interface-list. Each entry defines whether the matched interface is allowed or forbidden to participate in the RoMON network. If participation is allowed, the entry also specifies the port's cost.

Sub-menu: /tool/romon/port

Property Description

comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the entry.

cost (integer: 0..4294967295; Default: 100) Changes the port's cost.

disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Changes whether the entry is disabled.

interface (name; Default: ) Interface name or interface-list used for RoMON.

secrets (string; Default: ) sensitive List of individual port secrets used for RoMON message hashing.

A default entry with the interface-list "all" is preconfigured. This means that when the RoMON service is enabled, all interfaces are allowed to participate in the RoMON network by default. This default entry cannot be removed or enabled/disabled, but you can still modify its cost, set it to forbid participation, or configure secrets.

## Secrets

RoMON protocol secrets are used for message authentication, integrity check and replay prevention by means of hashing message contents with MD5.

For each interface, if the interface-specific secret list is empty, a global secret list is used. When sending out, messages are hashed with the first secret in list if list is not empty and first is not "empty secret" (empty string = ""), otherwise, messages are sent unhashed. When received, unhashed messages are only accepted if a secret list is empty or contains "empty secret", hashed messages are accepted if they are hashed with any of the secrets in list.

This design allows for the incremental introduction and/or change of secrets in-network without RoMON service interruption and can happen over RoMON itself, e.g.:

initially, all routers are without secrets; configure each router one by one with secrets="","mysecret" - this will make all routers still send unprotected frames, but they all will be ready to accept frames protected with secret "mysecret"; configure each router one by one with secrets="mysecret","" - this will make all routers use secret "mysecret", but also still accept unprotected frames (from routers that have not yet been changed); configure each router with secrets="mysecret" - this will make all routers use secret "mysecret" and also only accept frames protected with "mysecret";

Changing of secret in a network should be performed in a similar fashion where for some time both secrets are in use in network.

## Peer discovery

In order to discover all routers on RoMON network RoMON discover command must be used:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/discover Flags: A-active Columns: ADDRESS, COST, HOPS, PATH, L2MTU, IDENTITY, VERSION, BOARD ADDRESS COS H PATH L2MT IDENTITY VERSION BOARD A 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 200 1 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1500 hEX 6.47beta7 RB750Gr3 A 6C:3B:6B:ED:83:69 200 1 6C:3B:6B:ED:83:69 1500 CCR1009 6.47beta7 CCR1009-7G-1C-1S+ A B8:69:F4:B3:1B:D2 200 1 B8:69:F4:B3:1B:D2 1500 4K11 6.47beta7 RB4011iGS+5HacQ2HnD A CC:2D:E0:26:22:4D 200 1 CC:2D:E0:26:22:4D 1500 CCR1036 6.47beta7 CCR1036-8G-2S+ A CC:2D:E0:8D:01:88 200 1 CC:2D:E0:8D:01:88 1500 CRS328 6.47beta7 CRS328-24P-4S+ A E4:8D:8C:1C:D3:0E 200 1 E4:8D:8C:1C:D3:0E 1500 MikroTik 6.47beta7 RB2011iLS A E4:8D:8C:49:49:DB 200 1 E4:8D:8C:49:49:DB 1500 hAP 6.47beta7 RB962UiGS-5HacT2HnT

## Configuration Examples

In order for a device to participate in the RoMON network, the RoMON feature must be enabled and ports that participate in the RoMON network must be specified.

/tool romon set enabled=yes secrets=testing

Ports that participate in the RoMON network are configured in the RoMON port menu. Port list is a list of entries that match either specific port or all ports and specifies if matching port(s) is forbidden to participate in the RoMON network and in case port is allowed to participate in RoMON network entry also specifies the port cost. Note that all specific port entries have higher priority than the wildcard entry with interface=all.

For example, the following list specifies that all ports participate in RoMON network with cost 100 and ether7 interface with cost 200:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/port/print Flags: * - default Columns: INTERFACE, FORBID, COST # INTERF FO COS 0 * all no 100 1 ether7 no 200

By default, one wildcard entry with forbid=no and cost=100 is created.

Applications

Multiple applications can be run over the RoMON network.

In order to test the reachability of specific router on RoMON network RoMON ping command can be used:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/ping id=6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B count=5 SEQ HOST TIME STATUS 0 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms 1 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 0ms 2 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms 3 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 0ms 4 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=1ms

In order to establish a secure terminal connection to router on RoMON network RoMON SSH command can be used:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/ssh 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B

Run RoMON in WinBox by using CLI

In order to establish the RoMON session directly by using the command line on a computer, you must specify RoMON agents and desired routers addresses. RoMON agent must be saved on Managed routers list in WinBox in order to make a successful connection:

winbox.exe --romon 192.168.88.1 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B admin ""
