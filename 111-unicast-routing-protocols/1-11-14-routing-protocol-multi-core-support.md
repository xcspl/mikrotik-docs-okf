# Routing Protocol Multi-core Support

Overview

RouterOS v7 is capable of splitting tasks between multiple processes. There is one "main" task, which can start/stop sub-tasks and process data between those sub-tasks. Each sub-task can allocate "private" (only accessible by this particular task) and "shared" memory (accessible by all route tasks).

List of tasks that run in separate processes (if multiprocess routing is enabled):

rib-routing table calculations. fib-FIB update. Routing Policy configuration. configuration and reporting-Static configuration and getall handling (for example, "route print" command, SNMP monitoring of routing table, etc.). BFD protocol handling. Entire OSPF protocol handling. Entire RIP protocol handling. Entire ISIS protocol handling. EVPN handling. PIM-SM. LDP protocol handling. fantasy-handles generation of dummy routing entries for testing purposes. BGP connections and configuration handling; BGP receive (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters); BGP send (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters);

### BGP Sub-Tasks

BGP receive and send can be split into sub-tasks by specific parameters, for example, it is possible to run input per each peer or group all peer inputs and run them in the main process. This split by sub-tasks is controlled with **input.affinity** and **output.affinity** parameter configuration in **/routing** **/bgp/template**.It is possible to boost performance by playing with affinity values on devices with fewer cores since sharing data between tasks is a bit slower than processing the same data within one task. For example, on single-core or two-core devices running input and output in the main or instance process will boost performance.

BGP can have up to 100 unique processes.

All currently used tasks and their allocated private/shared memory can be monitored using the command:

/routing/stats/process/print

### Routing Table Update Mechanism

Illustration below tries to explain in more user friendly form on how routing table update mechanism is working.

Routing protocols continuously loop through following procedures:

"main" process waits for updates from other sub tasks (1); "main" starts to calculate new routes (2..4) if: update from sub task is received; protocol has not published all routes; configuration has changed or link state has changed. during new route calculation (5) following event occur: all received updates are applied to the route; gateway reachability is being determined; recursive route is being resolved; "publish" event is called where "current" routes are being published. During this phase, "current" routes will not change, but protocols can still receive and send updates (6). Do cleanup and free unused memory (7). In this step everything that is no longer used in new "current" table is removed (routes, attributes, etc.).

Consider "updated" and "current" as two copies of routing table, where "current" table (2) is the one used at the moment and "updated" (1) is table of candidate routes to be published in the next publish event (3 and 4). This method prevents protocols to fill memory with buffered updates while "main" process is doing "publish", instead protocols sends the newest update directly to "main" process which then copies new update in "updated" table. A bit more complicated is OSPF, it internally has similar process to select current OSPF routes which then are sent to the  "main" for further processing.
