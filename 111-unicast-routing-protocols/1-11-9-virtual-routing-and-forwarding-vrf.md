## Description

RouterOS allows to create multiple Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances on a single router. This is useful for BGP-based MPLS VPNs. Unlike BGP VPLS, which is OSI Layer 2 technology, BGP VRF VPNs work in Layer 3 and as such exchange IP prefixes between routers. VRFs solve the problem of overlapping IP prefixes and provide the required privacy (via separated routing for different VPNs).

It is possible to set up vrf-lite setups or use multi-protocol BGP with VPNv4 address family to distribute routes from VRF routing tables-not only to other routers, but also to different routing tables in the router itself.

## Configuration

VRF table is created in **/ip vrf** menu. After the VRF config is created routing table mapping is added (a dynamic table with the same name is created). Each active VRF will always have a mapped routing table.

[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print Flags: X-disabled; * - builtin 0 * name="main" interfaces=all

[admin@arm-bgp] /routing/table> print Flags: D-dynamic; X-disabled, I-invalid; U-used 0 D name="main" fib

Note that the order of the added VRFs is significant. To properly match which interface will belong to the VRF care must be taken to place VRFs in the correct order (matching is done starting from the top entry, just like firewall rules).

Since each VRF has mapped routing table, count of max unique VRFs is limited to 1024.

Let's look at the following example:

[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print Flags: X-disabled; * - builtin 0 * name="main" interfaces=all 1 name="myVrf" interfaces=lo_vrf

Since the first entry is matching all the interfaces, the second VRF will not have any interfaces added. To fix the problem order of the entries must be changed.

[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> move 1 0 [admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print Flags: X-disabled; * - builtin 0 name="myVrf" interfaces=lo_vrf 1 * name="main" interfaces=all

Connected routes from the interfaces assigned to the VRF will be installed in the right routing table automatically.

When the interface is assigned to the VRF as well as connected routes it does not mean that RouterOS services will magically know which VRF to use just by specifying the IP address in the configuration. Each service needs VRF support to be added and explicit configuration. Whether the service has VRF support and has VRF configuration options refer to appropriate service documentation.

For example, let's make an SSH service to listen for connections on the interfaces belonging to the VRF:

[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/service> set ssh vrf=myVrf [admin@arm-bgp] /ip/service> print Flags: X, I-INVALID Columns: NAME, PORT, CERTIFICATE, VRF # NAME PORT CERTIFICATE VRF 0 telnet 23 main 1 ftp 21 2 www 80 main 3 ssh 22 myVrf 4 X www-ssl 443 none main 5 api 8728 main 6 winbox 8291 main 7 api-ssl 8729 none main

Adding routes to the VRF is as simple as specifying the routing-table parameter when adding the route and specifying in which routing table to resolve the gateway by specifying @name after the gateway IP:

/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@myVrf routing-table=myVrf

Traffic leaking between VRFs is possible if the gateway is explicitly set to be resolved in another VRF, for example:

# add route in the myVrf, but resolve the gateway in the main table /ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=myVrf

# add route in the main table, but resolve the gateway in the myVrf /ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@myVrf

If the gateway configuration does not have an explicitly configured table to be resolved in, then it is considered, that gateway should be resolved in the "main" table.

## Supported features

Different services can be placed in specific VRF on which the service is listening for incoming or creating outgoing connections. By default, all services are using the main table, but it can be changed with a separate vrf parameter or by specifying the VRF name separated by "@" at the end of the IP address.

Below is the list of supported services.

Starting from RouterOS version 7.14, these rules no longer target individual interfaces within a VRF, but rather the VRF interface as a whole. Started from version 7.14 when interfaces are added in VRF-virtual VRF interface is created automatically. If it is needed to match traffic which belongs to /ip firewall filter add chain=input in-interface=vrf5 action=accept If there are several interfaces in one VRF but it is needed to match only one of these interfaces-marks should be used. For example:|
|/ip firewall mangle /ip firewall filter|/ip vrf add interface=ether15,ether16 vrf=vrf1516 mark=input_allow passthrough=yes add action=accept chain=input connection-mark=input_allow|add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new in-interface=ether15 new-connection-|
|Examples|Simple VRF-Lite setup|Let's consider a setup where we need two customer VRFs that require access to the internet:|

/ip address add address=172.16.1.2/24 interface=public add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=ether1 add address=192.168.2.1/24 interface=ether2

/ip route add gateway=172.16.1.1

# add VRF configuration /ip vrf add name=cust_a interface=ether1 place-before 0 add name=cust_b interface=ether2 place-before 0

# add vrf routes /ip route add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_a add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_b

# masquerade local source /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=public action=masquerade

It might be necessary to ensure that packets coming in the "public" interface can actually reach the correct VRF. This can be solved by marking new connections originated by the VRF customers and steering the traffic by routing marks of incoming packets on the "public" interface.

# mark new customer connections /ip firewall mangle add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new new-connection-mark=\ cust_a_conn src-address=192.168.1.0/24 passthrough=no add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new new-connection-mark=\ cust_b_conn src-address=192.168.2.0/24 passthrough=no

# mark routing /ip firewall mangle add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=cust_a_conn \ in-interface=public new-routing-mark=cust_a add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=cust_b_conn \ in-interface=public new-routing-mark=cust_b

### Static inter-VRF routes

In general, it is recommended that all routes between VRF should be exchanged using BGP local import and export functionality. If that is not enough, static routes can be used to achieve this so-called route leaking.

There are two ways to install a route that has a gateway in a different routing table than the route itself.

The first way is to explicitly specify the routing table in the gateway field when adding a route. This is only possible when leaking a route and gateway from the "main" routing table to a different routing table (VRF). Example:

# add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in 'vrf1' routing table with gateway in the main routing table add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=10.3.0.1@main routing-table=vrf1

The second way is to explicitly specify the interface in the gateway field. The interface specified can belong to a VRF instance. Example:

# add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in the main routing table with gateway at 'ether2' VRF interface add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=10.3.0.1%ether2 routing-table=main # add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in the main routing table with 'ptp-link-1' VRF interface as gateway add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=ptp-link-1 routing-table=main

As can be observed, there are two variations possible-to specify gateway as ip_address%interface or to simply specify an interface. The first should be used for broadcast interfaces in most cases. The second should be used for point-to-point interfaces, and also for broadcast interfaces, if the route is a connected route in some VRF. For example, if you have an address 1.2.3.4/24 on interface ether2 that is put in a VRF, there will be a connected route to 1.2.3.0/24 in that VRF's routing table. It is acceptable to add a static route 1.2.3.0/24 in a different routing table with an interface-only gateway, even though ether2 is a broadcast interface:

add dst-address=1.2.3.0/24 gateway=ether2 routing-table=main

### Static VRF-Lite Connected route leaking

Sometimes it is necessary to access directly connected resources from another vrf. In our example setup we have two connected networks each in its own VRF. And we want to allow client1 to be able to access client2.

+-----------------+ |+-vrf1-+ +-vrf2-+| client1(*.2)-------||ip *.1| |ip *.1||-------client2(*.2) (10.11.0.0/24) |+------+ +------+| (10.12.0.0/24) +-----------------+

/ip address add address=10.11.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 add address=10.12.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus2

# add VRF configuration /ip vrf add name=vrfTest1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 place-before 0 add name=vrfTest2 interface=sfp-sfpplus2 place-before 0

We can say that connected network is reachable on specific vrf by setting gateway "interface@vrf"

# add vrf routes /ip route add dst-address=10.11.0.0/24 gateway="sfp-sfpplus1@vrfTest1" routing-table=vrfTest2 add dst-address=10.12.0.0/24 gateway="sfp-sfpplus2@vrfTest2" routing-table=vrfTest1

Verify routes and reachability:

Keep in mind that trying to leak overlapping networks will not work.

But now what if we want to access routers local address located in another vrf?

[admin@cl2] > /ping 111.11.0.1 src-address=111.12.0.2 SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS 0 111.11.0.1 timeout 1 111.11.0.1 timeout sent=2 received=0 packet-loss=100%

Approach with "interface@vrf" gateways works only when router is forwarding packets. To access local vrf addresses we need to route to the vrf interface.

# add vrf routes /ip route add dst-address=10.11.0.0/24 gateway=vrfTest1@vrfTest1 routing-table=vrfTest2 add dst-address=10.12.0.0/24 gateway=vrfTest2@vrfTest2 routing-table=vrfTest1

### Dynamic Vrf-Lite route leaking

With large enough setups static route leaking is not sufficient. Let's consider we have the same setup as in static route leaking example plus ipv6 addresses, just for demonstration.

/ip address add address=10.11.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 add address=10.12.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus2

# add VRF configuration /ip vrf add name=vrfTest1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 place-before 0 add name=vrfTest2 interface=sfp-sfpplus2 place-before 0

/ipv6 address add address=2001:1::1 advertise=no interface=sfp-sfpplus1 add address=2001:2::1 advertise=no interface=sfp-sfpplus2

We can use BGP VPN to leak local routes without actually establishing BGP session.

/routing bgp vpn add export.redistribute=connected .route-targets=1:1 import.route-targets=1:2 label-allocation-policy=per-vrf name=bgp-mpls-vpn-1 \ route-distinguisher=1.2.3.4:1 vrf=vrfTest1 add export.redistribute=connected .route-targets=1:2 import.route-targets=1:1 label-allocation-policy=per-vrf name=bgp-mpls-vpn-2 \ route-distinguisher=1.2.3.4:1 vrf=vrfTest2

Be careful with import/export route targets, if not set up properly local vrf routes from itself will be imported.

Now we can see that connected routes between VRFs are exchanged

[admin@CCR2004_2XS] > /routing route print where dst-address in 111.0.0.0/8 && afi=ip4 ... Ac afi=ip4 contribution=active dst-address=111.11.0.0/24 routing-table=vrfTest1 gateway=sfp- sfpplus1@vrfTest1 immediate-gw=sfp-sfpplus1 distance=0 scope=10 belongs-to="connected" local-address=111.11.0.1%sfp-sfpplus1@vrfTest1 debug.fwp-ptr=0x202421E0 Ay afi=ip4 contribution=best-candidate dst-address=111.12.0.0/24 routing-table=vrfTest1 label=17 gateway=vrfTest2@vrfTest2 immediate-gw=sfp-sfpplus2 distance=200 scope=40 target-scope=10 belongs-to="bgp-mpls-vpn-1-bgp-mpls-vpn-2-connected-export-import" bgp.ext-communities=rt:1:2 .atomic-aggregate=no .origin=incomplete debug.fwp-ptr=0x202425A0 Ay afi=ip4 contribution=best-candidate dst-address=111.11.0.0/24 routing-table=vrfTest2 label=16 gateway=vrfTest1@vrfTest1 immediate-gw=sfp-sfpplus1 distance=200 scope=40 target-scope=10 belongs-to="bgp-mpls-vpn-2-bgp-mpls-vpn-1-connected-export-import" bgp.ext-communities=rt:1:1 .atomic-aggregate=no .origin=incomplete debug.fwp-ptr=0x202424E0 Ac afi=ip4 contribution=active dst-address=111.12.0.0/24 routing-table=vrfTest2 gateway=sfp- sfpplus2@vrfTest2 immediate-gw=sfp-sfpplus2 distance=0 scope=10 belongs-to="connected" local-address=111.12.0.1%sfp-sfpplus2@vrfTest2 debug.fwp-ptr=0x20242240

And IPv6 too:

### Dynamic Vrf-Lite route leaking (old workaround)

Before ROS v7.14 there were no mechanism to leak routes from one VRF instance to another within the same router.

As a workaround, it was possible to create a tunnel between two locally configure loopback addresses and assign each tunnel endpoint to its own VRF. Then it is possible to run either dynamic routing protocols or set up static routes to leak between both VRFs.

The downside of this approach is that tunnel must be created between each VRF where routes should be leaked (create a full mesh), which significantly complicates configuration even if there are just several VRFs, not to mention more complicated setups.

For example, to leak routes between 5 VRFs it would require n * ( n – 1) / 2 connections, which will lead to the setup with 20 tunnel endpoints and 20 OSPF instances on one router.

Example config with two VRFs of this method:

/interface bridge add name=dummy_custC add name=dummy_custB add name=lo1 add name=lo2

/ip address add address=111.255.255.1 interface=lo1 network=111.255.255.1 add address=111.255.255.2 interface=lo2 network=111.255.255.2 add address=172.16.1.0/24 interface=dummy_custC network=172.16.1.0 add address=172.16.2.0/24 interface=dummy_custB network=172.16.2.0

### The simplest MPLS VPN setup

In this example, a rudimentary MPLS backbone (consisting of two Provider Edge (PE) routers PE1 and PE2) is created and configured to forward traffic between Customer Edge (CE) routers CE1 and CE2 routers that belong to cust-one VPN.

CE1 Router

/ip address add address=10.1.1.1/24 interface=ether1 # use static routing /ip route add dst-address=10.3.3.0/24 gateway=10.1.1.2

CE2 Router

/ip address add address=10.3.3.4/24 interface=ether1 /ip route add dst-address=10.1.1.0/24 gateway=10.3.3.3

Let's take a closer look at IP routes in cust-one VRF. The 10.1.1.0/24 IP prefix is a connected route that belongs to an interface that was configured to belong to cust-one VRF. The 10.3.3.0/24 IP prefix was advertised via BGP as a VPNv4 route from PE2 and is imported in this VRF routing table, because our configured import-route-targets matched the BGP extended communities attribute it was advertised with.

### A more complicated setup (changes only)

As opposed to the simplest setup, in this example, we have two customers: cust-one and cust-two.

We configure two VPNs for them, cust-one and cust-two respectively, and exchange all routes between them. (This is also called "route leaking").

Note that this could be not the most typical setup, because routes are usually not exchanged between different customers. In contrast, by default, it should not be possible to gain access from one VRF site to a different VRF site in another VPN. (This is the "Private" aspect of VPNs.) Separate routing is a way to provide privacy, and it is also required to solve the problem of overlapping IP network prefixes. Route exchange is in direct conflict with these two requirements but may sometimes be needed (e.g. temp. solution when two customers are migrating to a single network infrastructure).

The route 10.1.1.0/24 was received from a remote BGP peer and is installed in both VRF routing tables.

The routes 10.3.3.0/24 and 10.4.4.0/24 are also installed in both VRF routing tables. Each is a connected route in one table and a BGP route in another table. This has nothing to do with their being advertised via BGP. They are simply being "advertised" to the local VPNv4 route table and locally reimported after that. Import and export route-targets determine in which tables they will end up.

This can be deduced from its attributes-they don't have the usual BGP properties. (Route 10.4.4.0/24.)
