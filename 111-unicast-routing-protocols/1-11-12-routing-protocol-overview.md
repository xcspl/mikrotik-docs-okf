Routing id VRF Management services support for VRFs telnet, ssh, api, www services can be set to listen on specific VRF Dynamically import/export routes from one vrf to another within the same router BFD Initial support

OSPF Convert OSPF config from v6 to v7 after Known conversion problems: upgrade NBMA neighbors place in backbone ospf-v2 networks + interface may have issues dynamic interfaces may have issues MPLS PE CE features are not converted

### Performance Status

Used hardware:

CCR1036, 16GB RAM (tile) CCR2004(arm64) CCR1100AHx4(arm) Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz 32GB RAM (as a host for CHRs)

The simulated upstream peer is a CHR router running ROSv6 with a copy of the global IPv4 routing table (585K routes loaded from MRT dump).

One Peer Receive Only

DUT establishes a connection to simulated upstream peers, receives routes, and installs them in FIB.

Two Peers Receive Only

DUT establishes a connection to two simulated upstream peers, receives routes, picks the best route, and installs in FIB. On ROSv7 affinity settings are set to "alone".

Multi-homing Sim

Two DUT devices establish eBGP sessions to simulated x86 upstream routers. Both DUTs are interconnected with the iBGP session. Each DUT receives routes from upstream and readvertises routes over iBGP. On ROSv7 affinity, settings are set to "alone" and early-cut disabled.
