## Summary

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows broadcasting the data over specific Bluetooth channels.

There are 40 unique bands (channels) and each band has a 2 MHz separation. 37, 38, and 39 channels are used for primary advertising, and 0-36 are used for data transmission.

During the advertising process, the BLE advertising packet is broadcasted. This packet contains the Preamble, Access Address, PDU and CRS fields.

The Preamble and Access Address fields help the receiver detect frames. CRS field is used to check errors. PDU consists of PDU Header and PDU Payload. PDU defines the packet itself.

PDU Header contains information about the PDU type. Based on the type, the payload fields may differ.

For example, when PDU type is ADV_NONCONN_IND → PDU Payload consists of "AdvA" (a field that contains information about the advertiser's address) and "AdvData" (a field that contains data information) fields:

1 octet = 1 byte = 8 bits

Preamble 1 octet

Access-Address 4 octets

PDU PDU Header = 2 octets PDU Payload = AdvA (6 octets)+AdvData (0...31 octets)

CRS 3 octets

There are different PDU types:

ADV_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for connectable, scannable undirected advertising); ADV_NOCONN_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for non-connectable, non-scannable undirected advertising); ADV_SCAN_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for scannable, undirected advertising); SCAN_REQ (where payload consists of ScanA [6octets] + AdvA [6octets], where ScanA field contains scanner's address and AdvA contains advertiser's address, and which is used for requesting SCAN_RSP response); SCAN_RSP (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + ScanRspData [0-31 octets], where ScanRspData can contain any data from the advertiser's host and which is used to respond to a SCAN_REQ request); ADV_DIRECT_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + TargetA [6octets], where TargetA is the device address field to which the PDU is addressed, and which is used for connectable, directed advertising); etc

You can find more information about the packet structure over here (Bluetooth specifications).

The main application for the Bluetooth interface in RouterOS is to monitor Bluetooth advertising packets (scanner feature) that are broadcasted by other devices (like for example, Bluetooth tags) or broadcast advertising packets (advertiser feature).

channel-map (37 | 38 | 39; Default: 37, 38, 39) Channels used for advertising.

disabled (yes | no; Default: yes) An option to disable or enable the Bluetooth chip to broadcast advertising packets.

max-interval (integer:20..10240; Default: 2560 The maximal interval for broadcasting advertising packets. ms)

min-interval (integer:20..10240; Default: 1280 ms) The minimal interval for broadcasting advertising packets.

If RPA can not be generated, the public address will be used instead. rpa-fallback-to-random → Same as "rpa-fallback-to-public" but if RPA can not be generated, the random-static address will be used instead.

phy (1M | 2M | CODED; default: 1M) Set "physical layer" for the device to use during advertising:

CODED → the lowest rate of 125 kbps = longer range; 1M → standard rate of 1 Mbps = average range; 2M → the highest rate of 2 Mbps = short range;

CODED is only supported by KNOT Embedded LTE.

legacy (yes | no) Set advertising type → extended or legacy.

When using legacy=no, AD structure length is extended up to 191 bytes. When using legacy=yes, AD structure length is limited at 31 bytes.

Legacy advertising uses only "primary" Bluetooth channel to advertise the payload. Extended advertising uses "primary" and "secondary" channels at the same time.

note: Advertising packets will be broadcasted each min-interval <= <= X max-interval milliseconds.

### AD structures

This section allows you to define the payload for the advertising packets that are going to be broadcasted by the Bluetooth chip.

Currently, only 4 types are supported: 0x08 "Shortened Local Name"; 0x09 "Complete Local Name"; 0xFF "Manufacturer Specific Data"; "Service Data"

You can check and set "AD structures" settings with the commands:

/iot bluetooth advertisers ad-structures print Columns: NAME, TYPE, DATA # NAME TYPE DATA 0 test short-local-name TEST /iot bluetooth advertisers ad-structures set

Configurable properties are shown below:

Property Description

data (string; Default: ) Define advertising packet's AdvData part of the payload

name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of AD structure

type (complete-local-name | manufacturer-data | short-local-name | service-data; Default: ) An option to set AD structure's type:

0x08 "Shortened Local Name" (in "text" format) 0x09 "Complete Local Name" (in "text" format) 0xFF "Manufacturer Specific Data" (in "hex" format) 0x20 "Service Data 32-bit" (in "hex" format)

If, for example, the "Shortened Local Name" type is chosen and the "data" field is configured with "TEST" → AdvData part of the payload is going to look like this:

05 08 54 45 53 54 (hexadecimal format)

, where the first octet (05) shows the number of bytes to follow (5 bytes) and the second octet (08) shows the type (Shortened Local Name). 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th (and etc) octets are the "data" [54 (hex)= (ASCII), 45 (hex)= T E (ASCII), 53 (hex)=S (ASCII), 54 (hex)= (ASCII)]. T

The same applies to the "Complete Local Name" type. Only the second octet in the AdvData payload is going to differ and will be set to 09.

For the "Manufacturer Specific Data" type, you will need to configure the "data" field in the hexadecimal format. The second octet for this type is going to be set to FF.

Connections

Availible starting with v7.12beta9.

Currenetly, only "central" role is supported. "Pheriperal device" role, "pairing" and "encryption" options are not supported.

Availible sections are:

Section Description

async-data used to view subscribed data.

characteristics used to view all supported characteristics of the device.

connect used to connect to the device that is in the connactable state.

disconnect used to disconnect from the device.

read used to read characteristics values.

write used to write characteristics values.

subscribe used to subscribe to a charasteristic value.

unsubscribe used to unsubscribe from a charasteristic value.

In order to connect to a Bluetooth device that is in the connactable state, use the command (where pdev is the device address):

/iot bluetooth connections connect pdev=DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D

To connect to TG-BT5-IN/OUT tags, make sure to put it into the connactable state by applying a magnet to the magnetic switch.

To view an already established connection:

/iot bluetooth connections print

To view device characteristics:

/iot bluetooth connections characteristics print Columns: PDEV, NAME, UUID # PDEV NAME UUID 0 DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D Service Changed 2a05 1 DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D Database Hash 2b2a 2 DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D Client Supported Features 2b29 3 DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D Device Name 2a00 4 DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D Appearance 2a01 ... ... ...

To read a specific characteristic, specify the pdev address and the uuid:

/iot bluetooth connections read pdev=DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D uuid=2a00

Scanners

In this menu, you can set up the scanner settings for the Bluetooth chip. When disabled, the device is no longer able to receive advertising reports. When enabled, you can monitor advertising reports in the "Advertising reports" tab (which will be explained later in the guide). You can check and set scanner settings with the commands:

/iot bluetooth scanners print Flags: X-DISABLED Columns: DEVICE, TYPE, INTERVAL, WINDOW, OWN-ADDRESS-TYPE, FILTER-POLICY, FILTER-DUPL ICATES # DEVICE TYPE INTERVAL WINDOW OWN-ADDRESS-TYPE FILTER-POLICY FIL 0 X bt1 passive 10ms 10ms random-static default off /iot bluetooth scanners set

Configurable properties are shown below:

Property Description

disabled (yes | no; Default: no) An option to disable or enable the Bluetooth chip to receive advertising reports.

filter-duplicates (keep-newest | An option to discard duplicate advertisements from the same advertiser: keep-oldest | keep-unique | off; Default: off) keep-newest → Keeps the newest report (discards the oldest). Only the newest PDU from a single AdvA will be kept. keep-oldest → Keeps the oldest report (discards the newest). Only the oldest PDU from a single AdvA will be kept. This type of PDU filtering happens at the controller level and as such it's the most efficient (energy /bandwidth-wise) method of duplicate filtering. keep-unique → Only displays advertisements that have a unique payload. Meaning, if 1+ identical payloads (AdvData) are found, only the first payload is going to be displayed, while the "clones" are discarded/ignored. off → Duplicates are not discarded. All PDUs with the same AdvA will be kept.

A advertising report is an advertising report sent from the same duplicate device address. The actual data ("AdvData" part of the payload) may change/differ and it is not considered significant when determining du cate advertising reports. Meaning that, for example, if the Bluetooth interface receives 10 payloads pli (payload after payload with a 1-second interval) from the same tag:

if you are using the "keep-oldest" setting → Bluetooth interface will only display the first payload received (9 follow-up payloads will be filtered out) from that tag. if you are using the "keep-newest" setting → Bluetooth interface will only display the last payload received (each follow-up payload will rewrite the previous one) from that tag.

filter-policy (default | whitelist | An option to set up a filtering policy (controller-level advertisement filtering): no; Default: default) default → When this policy is enabled, the scanner will only accept ADV_IND, ADV_NOCONN_IND, ADV_SCAN_IND, SCAN_RSP, and ADV_DIRECT_IND (where TargetA is the scanner's own Bluetooth address) PDU types. whitelist → When this policy is enabled, the scanner will only accept ADV_IND, ADV_NOCONN_IND, ADV_SCAN_IND, SCAN_RSP PDU types that are broadcasted by the advertiser, whose address is configured in the "Whitelist" section, and ADV_DIRECT_IND type PDU (where TargetA is the scanner's own Bluetooth address).

interval (integer:3..10240; Time after which scanner will start scanning the next advertisement channel. Default: 10 ms)

own-address-type (public | Address type used in scan requests (if active scanning type is used): random-static | rpa-fallback-to- public | rpa-fallback-to-random; public →  To use the IEEE registered, permanent address. Default: random-static) random-static →  To use user-configurable address (will be changed on the next power-cycle). rpa-fallback-to-public → To use Resolvable Random Private Address (RPA) that can only be resolved with our Identity Resolving Key (IRK). If RPA can not be generated, the public address will be used instead. rpa-fallback-to-random → Same as "rpa-fallback-to-public" but if RPA can not be generated, the random-static address will be used instead.

type (active | passive; Default: p Defines the scanner's type: assive) active → Scanner can send scan requests if it receives a scannable advertisement. The scanner can send a SCAN_REQ in order to acquire a SCAN_RSP response. passive → Scanner will only listen for advertisements, no data (e.g. scan requests) will be sent.

window (integer:3..10240; Defau The time that the scanner will spend scanning a single advertisement channel. lt: 10 ms)

phy (1M | 2M | CODED; default: Set "physical layer" for the device to use during scanning: 1M) CODED → the lowest rate of 125 kbps = longer range; 1M → standard rate of 1 Mbps = average range; 2M → the highest rate of 2 Mbps = short range;

CODED is only supported by KNOT Embedded LTE.

For example, if the scanner interval is set to 20ms, it means that only after 20ms, the device will begin scanning the next channel in line. If the scanner window is set to 10ms, it means that the device will scan each channel only during that 10ms window. Meaning, it will scan channel 37 for 10ms (window time) and begin scanning the next channel after 10 more ms (20ms[interval]-10ms[window]). It will take 10ms to scan channel 38, and after 10 more ms, the device will begin scanning channel 39.

Scanner will be able to capture both "extended" and "legacy" advertising types at the same time.

### Advertising reports

In this section, it is possible to monitor Bluetooth advertising reports (from the nearby broadcasters). The list is limited to 1024 entries (if the list gets full with 1024 entries, each new payload received will overwrite the "oldest" one). You can monitor advertising reports with the command:

/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print Columns: DEVICE, PDU-TYPE, TIME, ADDRESS-TYPE, ADDRESS, RSSI # DEV PDU-TYPE TIME ADDRES ADDRESS RSSI 0 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:30:56 public 2C:C8:1B:93:16:49 -24dBm 1 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:30:56 random 0B:16:17:9E:7B:EF -60dBm

It is possible to set up a filter for the reports with the command:

/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where

For example, to print reports that are broadcasted by a specific Bluetooth address, use the command:

/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where address=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX # DEVICE PDU-TYPE TIME ADD... ADDRESS RSSI LENGTH DATA 79 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:38 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -70dBm 30 02010... 80 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:43 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -67dBm 30 02010... 81 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:44 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -70dBm 28 1bff0... 82 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:48 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -75dBm 30 02010...

To show only advertising reports that have RSSI stronger than -30 dBm, use the command:

/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where rssi > -30 # DEVICE PDU-TYPE TIME ADDRESS-TYPE ADDRESS RSSI LENGTH DATA 307 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/29/2021 10:11:31 public 2C:C8:1B:93:16:49 -24dBm 22 15ff4f09.> 308 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/29/2021 10:11:31 public 2C:C8:1B:93:16:49 -26dBm 22 15ff4f09.>

Possible filters (you can filter the list of advertising reports with the help of the following parameters):

Filter Description

address Bluetooth advertisers address

address-type Advertisers address type (for example, public or random)

data Advertisement data in hex format (AdvData payload)

device Bluetooth chip/interface name

epoch Milliseconds since Unix Epoch

filter-comment Comment of the matching whitelist filter

length Advertisement data length

pdu-type Advertisement PDU type

rssi Signal strength

time Time of the advertisement packet reception

Whitelist

In this tab, it is possible to configure a whitelist that is going to be used in the filter policy in the "Scanners" section. In other words, an option to specify which Bluetooth addresses are going to be scanned (displayed in the "Advertising reports").

You can view the whitelisted entries with the command:

/iot bluetooth whitelist print Columns: DEVICE, ADDRESS-TYPE, ADDRESS # DEVICE ADDRESS-TYPE ADDRESS 0 bt1 any *:*:*:*:*:*

You can add a new whitelist entry with the command:

/iot bluetooth whitelist add

Configurable properties:

Property Description

address (MAC address; Default: ) Advertiser's address

address-type (any | public | random; Default: ) Advertiser's address type

comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the whitelisted entry

copy-from An option to copy an entry-for more information check the console documentation

device (bt1; Default: ) Select the Bluetooth interface/chip name

disabled (yes | no; Default: ) An option to disable or to enable the entry

Only 8 whitelisted entries can be added prior to 7.14beta8 version. Starting with 7.14beta8 version, whitelist is no longer limited to 8 entries and address field supports asterisk wildcards.

If, for example, you want to whitelist all MAC addresses that begin with "DC:2C:..." octets, add an entry using wildcard asterisk characters:

/iot bluetooth whitelist add address=DC:2C:*:*:*:*

Wildcard asterisk can not be used in-between specific octets, like "AA:*:*:BB:*:*" (it is an invaldi entry).

Valid entries would be:

AA:BB:CC:DD:*:* AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:* AA:*:*:*:*:*

### Peripheral Devices

This section displays decoded Eddystone TLM, Eddystone UID, iBeacon and MikroTik Bluetooth payloads. If the "Peripheral Devices" captures other beacon types, they will not be decoded.

You can view a decoded list with a print detail command:

You can filter the list, for example, based on the "address" of the device (knowing MAC-address of the tag):

/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices print detail where address="DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E" 0 address-type=public address=DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E name="my_tag" persist=yes mtik-key="" rssi=-60 last-data="15FF4F090100669DFCFF0600FCFF6117F1E50F000064" last-seen=2023-08-22 11:43:31 beacon-types=mikrotik mtik-version=1 mtik-encrypted=no mtik-acc-x=-0.015G mtik-acc-y=0.023G mtik-acc-z=-0.015G mtik-temperature=23.378C mtik-battery=100% mtik-uptime=1041905s mtik-flags=""

Or, for example, filter the list based on the beacon type:

/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices print detail where beacon-types=mikrotik 0 address-type=public address=DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E name="my_tag" persist=yes mtik-key="" rssi=-69 last-data="15FF4F0901000747020002000100611778E60F000064" last-seen=2023-08-22 11:45:46 beacon-types=mikrotik mtik-version=1 mtik-encrypted=no mtik-acc-x=0.007G mtik-acc-y=0.007G mtik-acc-z=0.003G mtik-temperature=23.378C mtik-battery=100% mtik-uptime=1042040s mtik-flags=""

Additionally, you have the option to set "persist=yes", which will make sure that the device/tag stays on the list forever (because devices that stop broadcasting payloads will be timed-out after one minute and removed from the list until new payloads start appearing in the air):

/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices set persist=yes address="DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E"

You can also set a name for the device, so you can easier find it on the list, with the command:

/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices set name="my_tag" address="DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E"

Decode-ad

In this menu, you can decode static MikroTik, Eddystone TLM, Eddystone UID and iBeacon payloads.

To decode a payload, just input it into the "data" field:

/iot bluetooth decode-ad data=0201060303AAFE1116AAFE20000B6E158402353AF20238576B type: eddystone-tlm version: 0 battery-voltage: 2.926V temperature: 21.515C packet-count: 37042930 uptime: 3724682.7s
