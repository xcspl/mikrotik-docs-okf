## <u>Summary</u>

Ethernet-like networks (Ethernet, Ethernet over IP, IEEE 802.11 in ap-bridge or bridge mode, WDS, VLAN) can be connected together using MAC bridges. The bridge feature allows the interconnection of hosts connected to separate LANs (using EoIP, geographically distributed networks can be bridged as well if any kind of IP network interconnection exists between them) as if they were attached to a single LAN. As bridges are transparent, they do not appear in the traceroute list, and no utility can make a distinction between a host working in one LAN and a host working in another LAN if these LANs are bridged. However, depending on the way the LANs are interconnected, latency and data rate between hosts may vary.

Network loops may emerge (intentionally or not) in complex topologies. Without any special treatment, loops would prevent the network from functioning normally, as they would lead to avalanche-like packet multiplication. Each bridge runs an algorithm that calculates how the loop can be prevented. (R/M)STP allows bridges to communicate with each other, so they can negotiate a loop-free topology. All other alternative connections that would otherwise form loops are put on standby, so that should the main connection fail, another connection could take its place. This algorithm exchanges configuration messages (BPDU-Bridge Protocol Data Unit) periodically, so that all bridges are updated with the newest information about changes in a network topology. (R/M)STP selects a root bridge which is responsible for network reconfiguration, such as blocking and opening ports on other bridges. The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest bridge ID.

## <u>Bridge Interface Setup</u>

To combine a number of networks into one bridge, a bridge interface should be created. Later, all the desired interfaces should be set up as its ports. By default, bridge MAC address will be chosen automatically, depending on the bridge port configuration. To avoid unwanted MAC address changes, it is recommended to disable "auto-mac" and manually specifying the MAC address by using "admin-mac".

Property Description

add-dhcp-option82 (ye s no |; Default: no) Starting from RouterOS version 7.23, this setting has been removed. Custom Remote ID and Circuit ID values can now be configured using predefined variables (such as BRIDGEMAC, HOSTNAME, INTERFACE, VID). See the dhcp-agent-circuit-id and dhcp-agent-remote-id properties below for details. If this setting was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format.

Whether to add DHCP Option 82 information (Agent Remote ID and Agent Circuit ID) to DHCP packets. Can be used together with Option 82 capable DHCP server to assign IP addresses and implement policies. This property only has an effect when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.

In RouterOS versions 7.22 or earlier, the values are predefined and cannot be modified:

For Agent Remote ID, RouterOS uses the bridge interface MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated). For Agent Circuit ID, RouterOS uses the interface name and VLAN ID separated by a colon (interface:vlan-id) where the DHCP client is connected. The VLAN ID is included only if vlan-filtering is enabled on the bridge.

For example (vlan-filtering=yes):

Agent Remote ID-cc:2d:e0:01:6a:43 Agent Circuit ID-ether2:10

admin-mac (MAC Static MAC address of the bridge. This property only has an effect when auto-mac is set to no. address; Default: none )

ageing-time (time; How long a host's information will be kept in the bridge database. Default: 00:05:00)

arp (disabled | Address Resolution Protocol setting enabled local-proxy-| arp | proxy-arp | reply-disabled-the interface will not use ARP only; Default: enabled) enabled-the interface will use ARP local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface proxy-arp-the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces reply-only-the interface will only respond to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address combinations that are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore, for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.

arp-timeout (auto | How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from IP address. Value auto equals to the integer; Default: auto) value of arp-timeout in ip/settings, default is 30s.

auto-mac (yes | no; When auto-mac=yes is configured, the bridge will automatically select a MAC address for the bridge interface based on Default: yes) the following order of priority:

1. From an Ethernet interface that is part of the bridge;
2. From a non-Ethernet interface in the bridge (e.g., WiFi or tunnel);
3. A randomly generated address if neither of the above is available.
If the configuration is changed, for example, you add a new port to the bridge, the bridge’s MAC address will be updated only if a higher-priority address source becomes available. For example, if the bridge initially used a randomly generated MAC, then an Ethernet interface was added, the MAC would update according to the highest available priority (in this case, the Ethernet interface). The bridge will also update the MAC address if the current MAC is associated with a port that is moved to a different bridge.

The current MAC address and its priority level are saved and will be reused after a reboot.

When auto-mac=no is configured, you can set a static MAC address manually using the admin-mac property.

comment (string; Short description of the interface. Default: )

dhcp-agent-circuit-id ( Specify the Circuit ID suboption value of the Option 82 for DHCP messages passing through the bridge. The string length string; Default: !dhcp-is limited to 255 characters. agent-circuit-id) This setting replaces the now deprecated add-dhcp-option82 property. If add-dhcp-option82 was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format: $(INTERFACE):$(VID). T his format will also be shown when configuring the setting through the GUI.

The following variables are supported:

$(BRIDGEMAC) - current bridge MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated); $(HOSTNAME) - system identity; $(INTERFACE) - interface name where the DHCP client is connected; $(VID) - VLAN ID used by the DHCP client. If the DHCP client is untagged, the VID corresponds to the port's pvid.  A pplies only when vlan-filtering is enabled on the bridge.

Variable syntax rules

Variables must be enclosed in parentheses and prefixed with a dollar sign ($). When configuring from the terminal, the dollar sign must be escaped with a backslash (\), otherwise it will be interpreted as a RouterOS script variable.

Example:

/interface bridge add add-dhcp-option82=yes dhcp-agent-circuit-id="interface: \$(INTERFACE), vlan: \$(VID)" dhcp-snooping=yes name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

This property has effect only when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.

dhcpv6-agent-circuit-Specify the Interface ID suboption value of the Option 18 for DHCPv6 messages passing through the bridge. The dhcpv6- id (string; Default: ! agent-circuit-id property follows the same rules as dhcp-agent-circuit-id. dhcpv6-agent-circuit- id)

dhcp-agent-remote-id Specify the Remote ID suboption value of the Option 82 for DHCP messages passing through the bridge. The string length (string; Default: !dhcp-is limited to 255 characters. agent-remote-id) This setting replaces the now deprecated add-dhcp-option82 property. If add-dhcp-option82 was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format: $(BRIDGEMAC). This format will also be shown when configuring the setting through the GUI.

The following variables are supported:

$(BRIDGEMAC) - current bridge MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated); $(HOSTNAME) - system identity; $(INTERFACE) - interface name where the DHCP client is connected; $(VID) - VLAN ID used by the DHCP client. If the DHCP client is untagged, the VID corresponds to the port's pvid.  A pplies only when vlan-filtering is enabled on the bridge.

Variable syntax rules

Variables must be enclosed in parentheses and prefixed with a dollar sign ($). When configuring from the terminal, the dollar sign must be escaped with a backslash (\), otherwise it will be interpreted as a RouterOS script variable.

Example:

/interface bridge add add-dhcp-option82=yes dhcp-agent-remote-id="ip: 192.168.88.1, identity: \$(HOSTNAME), mac: \$(BRIDGEMAC)" dhcp-snooping=yes name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

This property has effect only when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.

dhcpv6-agent-remote-Specify the Remote ID suboption value of the Option 37 for DHCPv6 messages passing through the bridge. The dhcpv6- id (string; Default: ! agent-remote-id property follows the same rules as dhcp-agent-remote-id. dhcpv6-agent-remote- id)

dhcp-snooping (yes | Enables or disables DHCP Snooping on the bridge. no; Default: no) Enabling the DHCP snooping feature will turn off bridge fast-path, which in turn affects the ability to fasttrack connections going over that bridge.

dhcpv6-snooping (yes Enables or disables DHCPv6 Snooping on the bridge. | no; Default: no) Enabling the DHCP snooping feature will turn off bridge fast-path, which in turn affects the ability to fasttrack connections going over that bridge.

disabled (yes | no; Changes whether the bridge is disabled. Default: no)

ether-type (0x9100 | Changes the EtherType, which will be used to determine if a packet has a VLAN tag. Packets that have a matching 0x8100 | 0x88a8; EtherType are considered as tagged packets. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. Default: 0x8100)

fast-forward (yes | no; Special and faster case of Fast Path which works only on bridges with 2 interfaces (enabled by default only for new Default: yes) bridges). More details can be found in the Fast Forward section.

forward-delay (time; The time which is spent during the initialization phase of the bridge interface (i.e., after router startup or enabling the Default: 00:00:15) interface) in the listening/learning state before the bridge will start functioning normally.

forward-reserved-Whether to forward IEEE reserved multicast MAC address that are in 01:80:C2:00:00:0x range. Bridges compliant with the addresses (yes | no: R/M/STP standards should refrain from forwarding these packets, this property can only be applied when protocol-mode Default: no) is set to none.

Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links, using bridge as media converters, or conducting network analysis).

Here are some notable MAC addresses and protocols used by RouterOS:

01:80:C2:00:00:00 - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP); 01:80:C2:00:00:01 - Ethernet Flow Control; 01:80:C2:00:00:02 - Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP); 01:80:C2:00:00:03 - Dot1x client and server; 01:80:C2:00:00:08 - Spanning Tree Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using ether-type=0x88a8); 01:80:C2:00:00:0D-Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using ether-type=0x88a8); 01:80:C2:00:00:0E-Link Layer Discovery Protocol Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group, and Precision Time Protocol;

The Flow Control MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:01 is an exception, it does not get forwarded by the bridge.

frame-types (admit-all Specifies allowed frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. | admit-only-untagged- and-priority-tagged | admit-only-vlan- tagged; Default: admit -all)

igmp-snooping (yes | Enables multicast group and port learning to prevent multicast traffic from flooding all interfaces in a bridge. no; Default: no)

igmp-version (2 | 3; Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an Default: ) 2 IGMP querier. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.

ingress-filtering (yes | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the no; Default: yes) bridge VLAN table. By default, VLANs that don't exist in the bridge VLAN table are dropped before they are sent out (egress), but this property allows you to drop the packets when they are received (ingress). Should be used with frame- types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect when vlan- filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.

l2mtu (read-only; L2MTU indicates the maximum size of the frame without a MAC header that can be sent by this interface. The L2MTU Default: ) value will be automatically set by the bridge and it will use the lowest L2MTU value of any associated bridge port. This value cannot be manually changed.

last-member-interval (t When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes to a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the ime; Default: 1s) bridge will send group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes the response time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (last-member- interval * last-member-query-count), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).

If the bridge port is configured with fast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.

This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.

last-member-query-How many times should last-member-interval pass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain count (integer: 0.. multicast stream. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes. 4294967295; Default: 2 )

max-hops (integer: 6.. Bridge count which BPDU can pass in an MSTP enabled network in the same region before BPDU is being ignored. This 40; Default: 20) property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.

max-learned-entries (i Sets the maximum number of learned hosts for the bridge interface. The default value is auto, and it depends on the nteger: 0.. installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default or choose unlimited option, but it increases 4294967295 | auto | the risk of out-of-memory condition. unlimited; Default: auto ) The default values for certain RAM sizes: 8192 for 64 MB; 16384 for 128 MB; 32768 for 256 MB; 65536 for 512 MB; 131072 for 1024 MB or higher.

This limit specifically applies to the bridge interface, not the hardware limits on the switch FDB table. Even if the bridge limit is reached, the switch can continue learn hosts up to its hardware limits and make correct forwarding decisions. However, these additional hosts will not show up in the "/interface bridge host" table nor can be monitored. Additionally, hitting this limit could impact MLAG host synchronization.

This setting has been available since RouterOS version 7.16.

max-message-age (ti Changes the Max Age value in BPDU packets, which is transmitted by the root bridge. A root bridge sends a BPDUs with me: 6s..40s; Default: 0 Max Age set to max-message-age value and a Message Age of 0. Every sequential bridge will increment the Message 0:00:20) Age before sending their BPDUs. Once a bridge receives a BPDU where Message Age is equal or greater than Max Age, the BPDU is ignored. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp or rstp.

membership-interval (t The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are ime; Default: 4m20s) received on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.

mld-version (1 | 2; Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an Default: ) 1 MLD querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address, igmp-snooping and multica st-querier is set to yes.

mtu (integer; Default: Maximum transmission unit, by default, the bridge will set MTU automatically and it will use the lowest MTU value of any auto) associated bridge port. The default bridge MTU value without any bridge ports added is 1500. The MTU value can be set manually, but it cannot exceed the bridge L2MTU or the lowest bridge port L2MTU. If a new bridge port is added with L2MTU which is smaller than the actual-mtu of the bridge (set by the mtu property), then manually set value will be ignored and the bridge will act as if mtu=auto is set.

When adding VLAN interfaces on the bridge, and when VLAN is using higher MTU than default 1500, it is recommended to set manually the MTU of the bridge.

multicast-querier (yes Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices | no; Default: no) respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.

By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge to generate IGMP/MLD general membership queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network. Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.

Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with IPv4 0.0.0.0 source address, MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring values igmp-querier and mld-querier).

This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.

multicast-router (disab A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast led | permanent | streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge temporary-query; interface itself. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to the bridge interface for further Default: temporary-multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes. query) disabled-disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface. permanent-enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface. temporary-query-automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries.

name (text; Default: br Name of the bridge interface. idgeN)

port-cost-mode (long Changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic values based on interface | short; Default: long) speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configured path-cost  or internal-path-cost properties. Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate calculations for intermediate rates):

Data rate Long Short

10 Mbps 2,000,000 100

100 Mbps 200,000 19

1 Gbps 20,000 4

10 Gbps 2,000 2

25 Gbps 800 1

40 Gbps 500 1

50 Gbps 400 1

100 Gbps 200 1

For HW offloaded bond interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied, this value remains unaffected by the total link speed of the bonding.

For virtual interfaces (such as VLAN, EoIP, VXLAN and non-HW offloaded bond), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000 is assigned for long mode, and 10 for short mode.

For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10 for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to bridge, for instance, by using the CAPsMAN datapath.bridge-cost setting.

Use port monitor to observe the applied path-cost.

This property has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp rstp,, or mstp.

priority (integer: 0.. Bridge priority, used by R/STP to determine root bridge, used by MSTP to determine CIST and IST regional root bridge. 65535 decimal format This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none. or 0x0000-0xffff hex format; Default: 32768 / 0x8000)

protocol-mode (none Select Spanning tree protocol (STP) or Rapid spanning tree protocol (RSTP) to ensure a loop-free topology for any | rstp | stp | mstp; bridged LAN. RSTP provides a faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change. Select MSTP to ensure loop- Default: rstp) free topology across multiple VLANs.

The forwarding of reserved MAC addresses that are in 01:80:C2:00:00:0x range is separated the from protocol- mode=none, and is now available as a controllable property forward-reserved-addresses since RouterOS v7.16.

pvid (integer: 1..4094; Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. It applies e.g. to frames sent from Default: ) 1 bridge IP and destined to a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.

querier-interval (time; Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect when igmp- Default: 4m15s) snooping is set to yes.

query-interval (time; Changes the interval on how often IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is Default: 2m5s) acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes place when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.

query-response-The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is active as an IGMP/MLD querier. interval (time; Default: This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes. 10s)

region-name (text; MSTP region name. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp. Default: )

region-revision (intege MSTP configuration revision number. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp. r: 0..65535; Default: )0

ra-guard (yes | no; RA guard-security feature that validates incoming Router Advertisements against a list of authorized, trusted ports. Default: no)

startup-query-count (i Specifies how many times general IGMP/MLD queries must be sent when bridge interface is enabled or active querier nteger: 0.. timeouts. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes. 4294967295; Default: 2 )

startup-query-interval ( Specifies the interval between startup general IGMP/MLD queries. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping time; Default: 31s250 and multicast-querier is set to yes. ms)

transmit-hold-count (in The Transmit Hold Count used by the Port Transmit state machine to limit the transmission rate. teger: 1..10; Default: )6

vlan-filtering (yes | no; Globally enables or disables VLAN functionality for the bridge. Default: no)

Changing certain properties can cause the bridge to temporarily disable all ports. This must be taken into account whenever changing such properties on production environments since it can cause all packets to be temporarily dropped. Such properties include vlan-filtering, protocol-mode igmp-snooping fast-forward,, and others.

Example

To add and enable a bridge interface that will forward L2 packets:

[admin@MikroTik] > interface bridge add [admin@MikroTik] > interface bridge print Flags: X-disabled, R-running 0 R name="bridge1" mtu=auto actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=65535 arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto mac-address=5E:D2:42:95: 56:7F protocol-mode=rstp fast-forward=yes igmp-snooping=no auto-mac=yes ageing-time=5m priority=0x8000 max-message-age=20s forward-delay=15s transmit- hold-count=6 vlan-filtering=no dhcp-snooping=no

## <u>Spanning Tree Protocol</u>

RouterOS bridge interfaces are capable of running Spanning Tree Protocol to ensure a loop-free and redundant topology. For small networks with just 2 bridges STP does not bring many benefits, but for larger networks properly configured STP is very crucial, leaving STP-related values to default may result in a completely unreachable network in case of an even single bridge failure. To achieve a proper loop-free and redundant topology, it is necessary to properly set bridge priorities, port path costs, and port priorities.

In RouterOS it is possible to set any value for bridge priority between 0 and 65535, the IEEE 802.1W standard states that the bridge priority must be in steps of 4096. This can cause incompatibility issues between devices that do not support such values. To avoid compatibility issues, it is recommended to use only these priorities: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, 61440

STP has multiple variants, currently, RouterOS supports STP, RSTP, and MSTP. Depending on needs, either one of them can be used, some devices are able to run some of these protocols using hardware offloading, detailed information about which device support it can be found in the Hardware Offloading section. STP is considered to be outdated and slow, it has been almost entirely replaced in all network topologies by RSTP, which is backward compatible with STP. For network topologies that depend on VLANs, it is recommended to use MSTP since it is a VLAN aware protocol and gives the ability to do load balancing per VLAN groups. There are a lot of considerations that should be made when designing an STP enabled network, more detailed case studies can be found in the Spanning Tree Protocol article. In RouterOS, the protocol-mode property controls the used STP variant.

RouterOS bridge does not work with PVST and its variants. The PVST BPDUs (with a MAC destination 01 0C:CC:CC:CD) are treated :00: by RouterOS bridges as typical multicast packets. In simpler terms, they undergo RouterOS bridge/switch forwarding logic and may get tagged or untagged.

By the IEEE 802.1ad standard, the BPDUs from bridges that comply with IEEE 802.1Q are not compatible with IEEE 802.1ad bridges, this means that the same bridge VLAN protocol should be used across all bridges in a single Layer2 domain, otherwise (R/M)STP will not function properly.

## Per-port STP

There might be certain situations where you want to limit STP functionality on single or multiple ports. Below you can find some examples for different use cases.

Be careful when changing the default (R/M)STP functionality, make sure you understand the working principles of STP and BPDUs. Misconfigured (R/M)STP can cause unexpected behavior.

Create edge ports

Setting a bridge port as an edge port will restrict it from sending BPDUs and will ignore any received BPDUs:

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 edge=yes add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2

Drop received BPDUs

The bridge filter or NAT rules cannot drop BPDUs when the bridge has STP/RSTP/MSTP enabled due to the special processing of BPDUs. However, dropping received BPDUs on a certain port can be done on some switch chips using ACL rules:

On MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch:

/interface ethernet switch rule add dst-mac-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-dst-ports="" ports=ether1 switch=switch1

Access Control List (ACL) supportOn CRS1xx/CRS2xx with :

/interface ethernet switch acl add action=drop mac-dst-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00 src-ports=ether1

In this example all received BPDUs on ether1 are dropped.

If you intend to drop received BPDUs on a port, then make sure to prevent BPDUs from being sent out from the interface that this port is connected to. A root bridge always sends out BPDUs and under normal conditions is waiting for a more superior BPDU (from a bridge with a lower bridge ID), but the bridge must temporarily disable the new root-port when transitioning from a root bridge to a designated bridge. If you have blocked BPDUs only on one side, then a port will flap continuously.

Enable BPDU guard

In this example, if ether1 receives a BPDU, it will block the port and will require you to manually re-enable it.

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 bpdu-guard=yes add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2

Enable Root guard

In this example, ether1 is configured with restricted-role=yes. It prevented the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree.

## <u>Bridge Settings</u>

Under the bridge settings menu, it is possible to control certain features for all bridge interfaces and monitor global bridge counters.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge settings

Property Description

use-ip-firewall (y Direct bridged traffic to IP/IPv6 firewall (prerouting, forward, and postrouting sections of IP/IPv6 routing, see more details on Pack es | no; Default: et Flow article). Below are some use cases when this setting can be enabled to accomplish certain tasks: no) In case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Tree for traffic flowing through bridged ports. In case you want to use IP/IPv6 firewall capabilities for traffic flowing through bridged ports, which would normally bypass IP /IPv6 firewall.

Enabling the use-ip-firewall feature will turn off bridge Fast Path, which in turn affects the ability to fasttrack connections going over that bridge. And because this setting introduces additional processing steps (prerouting, forward and postrouting chains), it will increase CPU usage even more when forwarding packets.

Routed traffic, including traffic from VLAN interfaces (e.g., /interface/vlan created on the bridge), is already processed by the IP firewall. In such cases, enabling this setting has no additional effect.

use-ip-firewall-Direct bridged un-encrypted PPPoE encapsulated traffic to IP/IPv6 firewall. This property only has an effect when use-ip- for-pppoe (yes | firewall is set to yes. no; Default: no)

use-ip-firewall-Direct bridged VLAN tagged traffic to IP/IPv6 firewall. This property only has an effect when use-ip-firewall is set to yes. for-vlan (yes | no; Default: no) If you need to use the IP/IPv6 firewall and bridge vlan-filtering is enabled (which involves VLAN tag handling), then you should also enable use-ip-firewall-for-vlan=yes.

When this setting is enabled and packets are routed between VLAN interfaces (e.g., /interface/vlan), the in-interface in the IP firewall's prerouting chain will match the bridge interface instead of the individual VLAN interface.

allow-fast-path ( Whether to enable a bridge Fast Path globally. yes | no; Default: yes)

bridge-fast-path-Shows whether a bridge Fast Path is active globally, Fast Path status per bridge interface is not displayed. active (yes | no; Default: )

bridge-fast-path-Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Path. packets (integer; Default: )

bridge-fast-path-Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Path. bytes (integer; Default: )

bridge-fast-Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward. forward-packets ( integer; Default: )

bridge-fast-Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward. forward-bytes (i nteger; Default: )

In case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees to traffic that is being forwarded by a bridge, then you need to enable the use-ip-firewall property. Without using this property the bridge traffic will never reach the postrouting chain, Simp le Queues and global Queue Trees are working in the postrouting chain. To assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees for VLAN or PPPoE traffic in a bridge you should enable appropriate properties as well.

## <u>Port Settings</u>

Port submenu is used to add interfaces in a particular bridge.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port

Property Description

auto-isolate (y When enabled, prevents a port moving from discarding into forwarding state if no BPDUs are received from the neighboring es | no; bridge. The port will change into a forwarding state only when a BPDU is received. This property only has an effect when protoco Default: no) l-mode is set to rstp or mstp and edge is set to no.

When disabled, drops broadcast traffic on egress ports. flood (yes | no; Can be used to filter all broadcast traffic on an egress port. Broadcast traffic is considered as traffic that uses FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF a Default: yes) s destination MAC address, such traffic is crucial for many protocols such as DHCP, ARP, NDP, BOOTP (Netinstall), and others. This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU.

edge (auto | Set port as edge port or non-edge port, or enable edge discovery. Edge ports are connected to a LAN that has no other bridges no | no-attached. An edge port will skip the learning and the listening states in STP and will transition directly to the forwarding state, this discover | yes reduces the STP initialization time. If the port is configured to discover edge port then as soon as the bridge detects a BPDU | yes-discover; coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none. Default: auto) no-non-edge port with disabled discovery, will participate in learning and listening states in STP. It will not transition to the forwarding state until it exchanges BPDUs and reaches agreement with the connected bridge. If no BPDU is received, the port may remain in a non-forwarding state indefinitely. no-discover-non-edge port with enabled discovery, will participate in learning and listening states in STP, a port can become an edge port if no BPDU is received. yes-edge port without discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state. yes-discover-edge port with enabled discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state. auto-same as no-discover, but will additionally detect if a bridge port is a Wireless interface with disabled bridge-mode, such interface will be automatically set as an edge port without discovery.

fast-leave (yes Enables IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when an | no; Default: no IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes. )

frame-types (a Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. dmit-all | admit-only- untagged-and- priority-tagged | admit-only- vlan-tagged; Default: admit- all)

ingress-Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge filtering (yes | VLAN table. Should be used with frame-types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only no; Default: yes has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7. )

learn (auto | Changes MAC learning behavior on a bridge port no | yes; Default: auto) yes-enables MAC learning no-disables MAC learning auto-detects if bridge port is a Wireless interface and uses a Wireless registration table instead of MAC learning, will use Wireless registration table if the Wireless interface is set to one of ap-bridge bridge wds-slave,, mode and bridge mode for the Wireless interface is disabled.

multicast-A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and router (disable IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This property d | permanent can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to certain bridge ports for further multicast routing or proxying. This property | temporary-only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes. query; Default: temporary-disabled-disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports query) are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it. permanent-enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it. temporary-query-automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries.

horizon (intege Use split horizon bridging to prevent bridging loops. Set the same value for a group of ports, to prevent them from sending data to r 0.. ports with the same horizon value. Split horizon is a software feature that disables hardware offloading. 429496729; Default: none)

hw (yes | no; Allows to enable or disable hardware offloading on interfaces capable of HW offloading. For software interfaces like EoIP or VLAN Default: yes) this setting is ignored and has no effect. Certain bridge or port functions can automatically disable HW offloading, use the print command to see whether the "H" flag is active.

internal-path-Path cost to the interface for MSTI0 inside a region. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the internal- cost (integer: path-cost based on the interface speed and the port-cost-mode setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove

1..200000000; any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before the internal-path-cost property. This property only has Default: ) effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.
/interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !internal-path-cost

Use port monitor to observe the applied internal-path-cost.

interface (name Name of the interface or interface list.; Default: none)

path-cost (inte Path cost to the interface, used by STP and RSTP to determine the best path, and used by MSTP to determine the best path ger: 1.. between regions. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the path-cost based on the interface speed and 200000000; the port-cost-mode setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an Default: ) exclamation mark before the path-cost property. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.

/interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !path-cost

Use port monitor to observe the applied path-cost.

point-to-point ( Specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of failure. By setting this auto | yes | no; property to yes, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and Default: auto)  waits for BPDUs from other devices from this single link. By setting this property to no, you are expecting that a link can receive BPDUs from multiple devices. By setting the property to yes, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In general, you should only set this property to no if it is possible that another device can be connected between a link, this is mostly relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex, auto enables point-to-point functionality. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.

priority (integer The priority of the interface, used by STP to determine the root port, used by MSTP to determine root port between regions. : 0..240; Default: 128)

pvid (integer Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect when vlan-

1..4094; filtering is set to yes. Default: ) 1 restricted-role ( Enables or disables the restricted role on a port. When enabled, it prevents the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or yes | no; any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) Default: no) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no
longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree, a feature also known as root-guard or root-protection. This property has an effect when prot ocol-mode is set to stp rstp,, or mstp (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).

restricted-tcn ( Enables or disables topology change notification (TCN) handling on a port. When enabled, it causes the port not to propagate yes | no; received topology change notifications to other ports, and any changes caused by the port itself does not result in topology Default: no) change notification to other ports. This parameter is disabled by default. It can be set by a network administrator to prevent external bridges causing MAC address flushing in local network. This property has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp, rstp, or mstp (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).

tag-stacking (y Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN tag regardless if es | no; a VLAN tag already exists, packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the pvid value and will use EtherType that is Default: no) specified in ether-type. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.

trusted (yes | When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCP packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to limit unauthorized no; Default: no) servers to provide malicious information for users. This property only has an effect when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.

trusted-When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCPv6 packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to limit dhcpv6 (yes | unauthorized servers to provide malicious information for users. This property only has an effect when dhcpv6-snooping is set no; Default: no) to yes.

trusted-ra (yes Specifies whether the port is permitted to forward IPv6 Router Advertisement messages; set to yes for ports connected to | no; Default: no legitimate routers and no to block unauthorized sources. This property only has an effect when ra-guard is set to yes. )

unknown-Changes the multicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast-flood multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the (yes | no; specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic, this includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e. Default: yes) g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1).

Note that when igmp-snooping is enabled and IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.

When using this setting together with igmp-snooping, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known multicast from the MDB table.

unknown-Changes the unknown unicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows unicast-flood ( flooding unknown unicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts unknown unicast traffic from yes | no; being flooded to the specified bridge port. Default: yes) If a MAC address is not learned in, then the traffic is considered as unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all the host table ports. MAC address is learned as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received and the source MAC address is added to the bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learned.

RouterOS can handle a maximum of 1024 bridged interfaces per bridge, this limit is fixed and cannot be modified. If you try to add more interfaces as bridge ports, it may lead to unpredictable behavior.

## Example

To group ether1 and ether2 in the already created bridge1 interface.

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 [admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 [admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port print Flags: X-disabled, I-inactive, D-dynamic, H-hw-offload # INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON 0 ether1 bridge1 yes 100 0x80 10 10 none 1 ether2 bridge1 yes 200 0x80 10 10 none

### Interface lists

Starting with RouterOS v6.41 it possible to add interface lists as a bridge port and sort them. Interface lists are useful for creating simpler firewall rules. Below is an example how to add an interface list to a bridge:

/interface list add name=LAN1 add name=LAN2 /interface list member add interface=ether1 list=LAN1 add interface=ether2 list=LAN1 add interface=ether3 list=LAN2 add interface=ether4 list=LAN2 /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN1 add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN2

Ports from an interface list added to a bridge will show up as dynamic ports:

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port> pr Flags: X-disabled, I-inactive, D-dynamic, H-hw-offload # INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON 0 LAN1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 1 D ether1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 2 D ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 3 LAN2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 4 D ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 5 D ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none

It is also possible to sort the order of lists in which they appear. This can be done using the move command. Below is an example of how to sort interface lists:

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port move 3 0 [admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print Flags: X-disabled, I-inactive, D-dynamic, H-hw-offload # INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON 0 LAN2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 1 D ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 2 D ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 3 LAN1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 4 D ether1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 5 D ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none

The second parameter when moving interface lists is considered as "before id", the second parameter specifies before which interface list should be the selected interface list moved. When moving the first interface list in place of the second interface list, then the command will have no effect since the first list will be moved before the second list, which is the current state either way.

### Interface lists in VLAN table

Starting from RouterOS version 7.17, you can use interface lists for the tagged and untagged properties in the bridge VLAN table. This change allows for more flexible VLAN assignment to ports by simply modifying the interface list members, rather than updating each bridge VLAN entry individually.

If different interface lists are specified for the tagged and untagged settings, and there is overlap between the interface members, the untagged list will take priority. You can check the current interface configuration with current-tagged and current-untagged properties using the print command.

Below is an example where new interfaces are added to already existing interface lists. This shows how the bridge port and VLAN tables are automatically updated without directly changing settings in those menus.

/interface list add name=vlan10_untagged add name=vlan20_untagged add name=vlan_tagged /interface list member add interface=ether2 list=vlan10_untagged add interface=ether3 list=vlan10_untagged add interface=ether4 list=vlan20_untagged add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 list=vlan_tagged /interface bridge add frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=vlan10_untagged pvid=10 add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=vlan20_untagged pvid=20 add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged interface=vlan_tagged /interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=vlan_tagged vlan-ids=10 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=vlan_tagged vlan-ids=20

## Bridge Port Monitoring

To monitor the current status of bridge ports, use the monitor command.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port monitor

Property Description

role (designa ted | root- port | alternate | backup | disabled)

Shows if a multicast router is detected on the port. Monitoring value appears only when igmp-snooping is enabled.

VLANs where the interface is registred via MVRP Protocol.

In Spanning Tree Protocol each port has a unique Port Identifier. Priority[hex] + port number.

Whether the port is connected to a bridge port using full-duplex (yes) or half-duplex (no).

(R/M)STP algorithm assigned port role:

disabled-port-disabled or inactive port. root-port-port that is facing towards the root bridge and has the best (lowest cost) path to the root bridge. Only one root port is elected per bridge (except the root bridge itself). alternative-port-port that is facing towards the root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic. Port provides a backup path to the root bridge if the current root port fails. designated-port-port that is facing away from the root bridge and forwards traffic away from the root bridge to downstream devices. backup-port-port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is going to forward traffic. Port that serves as a backup for a designated port on the same segment.

In RouterOS, the role monitoring property displays RSTP roles, such as alternate-port and backup-port, even when STP mode is enabled. While this is technically incorrect, it does not affect the operation of STP. This is because STP treats all blocked ports the same, without differentiating their purpose (e.g., as potential backup paths). The displayed roles are simply a reflection of RSTP functionality and have no practical impact when STP is in use. See more details on STP and RSTP page.

The total cost of the path to the root-bridge.

Whether the port is using RSTP or MSTP BPDU types. A port will transit to STP type when RSTP/MSTP enabled port receives an STP BPDU. This settings does not indicate whether the BDPUs are actually sent.

## <u>Hosts Table</u>

MAC addresses that have been learned on a bridge interface can be viewed in the menu. Below is a table of parameters and flags that can be host viewed.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge host

Property Description

bridge (read-only: The bridge the entry belongs to name)

disabled (read-only: Whether the static host entry is disabled flag)

dynamic (read-only: Whether the host has been dynamically created flag)

external (read-only: Whether the host has been learned using an external table, for example, from a switch chip or Wireless registration table. flag) Adding a static host entry on a hardware-offloaded bridge port will show no flag.

invalid (read-only: flag) Whether the host entry is invalid, can appear for statically configured hosts on already removed interface

local (read-only: flag) Whether the host entry is created from the bridge itself (that way all local interfaces are shown)

mac-address (read-Host's MAC address only: MAC address)

on-interface (read-Which of the bridged interfaces the host is connected to only: name)

Monitoring

To get the active hosts table:

||[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge host print # MAC-ADDRESS VID ON-INTERFACE BRIDGE 0 D B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7 ether1 bridge1 1 D B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D8 ether2 bridge1 2 DL CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:38 bridge1 bridge1 3 DL CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:39 ether2 bridge1|Flags: X-disabled, I-invalid, D-dynamic, L-local, E-external|
|---|---|---|
|Static entries Sub-menu: /interface bridge host||It is possible to add a static MAC address entry into the host table. This can be used to forward a certain type of traffic through a specific port. Another use case for static host entries is to protect the device resources by disabling dynamic learning and relying only on configured static host entries. Below is a table of possible parameters that can be set when adding a static MAC address entry into the host table.|
|Property||Description|
|bridge (name; Default: none) disabled (yes | no; Default: no) interface (name; Default: none) mac-address (MAC address; Default:) vid (integer: 1..4094; Default:) used:||The bridge interface to which the MAC address is going to be assigned. Disables/enables static MAC address entry. Name of the interface. MAC address that will be added to the host table statically. VLAN ID for the statically added MAC address entry. For example, if it was required that all traffic destined to 4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43 is forwarded only through ether2, then the following commands can be|
|/interface bridge host|add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43||
|Multicast Table Sub-menu: /interface bridge mdb||When IGMP/MLD snooping is enabled, the bridge will start to listen to IGMP/MLD communication, create multicast database (MDB) entries, and make forwarding decisions based on the received information. Packets with link-local multicast destination addresses 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 are not restricted and are always flooded on all ports and VLANs. To see learned multicast database entries, use the print command.|
|Property||Description|

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge mdb print Flags: D-DYNAMIC Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE # GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE 0 D ff02::2 1 bridge1 bridge1 1 D ff02::6a 1 bridge1 bridge1 2 D ff02::1:ff00:0 1 bridge1 bridge1 3 D ff02::1:ff01:6a43 1 bridge1 bridge1 4 D 229.1.1.1 10 ether2 bridge1 5 D 229.2.2.2 10 ether3 bridge1 ether2 6 D ff02::2 10 ether5 bridge1 ether3 ether2 ether4

### Static entries

Since RouterOS version 7.7, it is possible to create static MDB entries for IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge mdb

Property Description

bridge (name; The bridge interface to which the MDB entry is going to be assigned. Default: )

disabled (yes | no; Disables or enables static MDB entry. Default: no)

group (ipv4 | ipv6 | The IPv4, IPv6 or MAC multicast address. Static entries for link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 cannot be MAC address; created, as these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs. Default: )

interface (name; The list of bridge ports to which the multicast group will be forwarded. Default: )

vid (integer: 1..4094; The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created, only applies when vlan-filtering is enabled. When VLAN ID is Default: ) not specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply on all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports.

For example, to create a static MDB entry for multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:

/interface bridge mdb add bridge=bridge1 group=229.10.10.10 interface=ether2,ether3 vid=10

Verify the results with the print command:

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge mdb print where group=229.10.10.10 Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE # GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE 12 229.10.10.10 10 ether2 bridge1 ether3

In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a static MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group ff02::2 on all VLANs and ports (modify the ports setting for your particular setup):

/interface bridge mdb add bridge=bridge1 group=ff02::2 interface=bridge1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge mdb print where group=ff02::2 Flags: D-DYNAMIC Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE # GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE 0 ff02::2 bridge1 15 D ff02::2 1 bridge1 bridge1 16 D ff02::2 10 bridge1 bridge1 ether2 ether3 ether4 ether5 17 D ff02::2 20 bridge1 bridge1 ether2 ether3 18 D ff02::2 30 bridge1 bridge1 ether2 ether3

## <u>Bridge Hardware Offloading</u>

It is possible to switch multiple ports together if a device has a built-in switch chip. While a bridge is a software feature that will consume CPU's resources, the bridge hardware offloading feature will allow you to use the built-in switch chip to forward packets. This allows you to achieve higher throughput if configured correctly.

In previous versions (prior to RouterOS v6.41) you had to use the master-port property to switch multiple ports together, but in RouterOS v6.41 this property is replaced with the bridge hardware offloading feature, which allows your to switch ports and use some of the bridge features, for example, S panning Tree Protocol.

When upgrading from previous versions (before RouterOS v6.41), the old master-port configuration is au tomatically converted to the newBr idge Hardware Offloading configuration. When downgrading from newer versions (RouterOS v6.41 and newer) to older versions (before RouterOS v6.41) the configuration is not converted back, a bridge without hardware offloading will exist instead, in such a case you need to reconfigure your device to use the old master-port configuration.

Below is a list of devices and feature that supports hardware offloading (+) or disables hardware offloading (-):

Footnotes:

1. The HW offloading will be disabled only for the specific bridge port, not the entire bridge.
2.

2. Only 802.3ad (LACP), balance-xor (static LAG) and active-backup bonding modes are hardware offloaded. Other bonding modes do not support HW offloading.
3. MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch will always use Layer2+Layer3+Layer4 for a transmit hash policy. Changing the transmit hash policy manually while HW offloading is used will have no effect.
4. The 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips are limited to Layer2 transmit hash. Changing the transmit hash policy manually while HW offloading is used will have no effect.
5. The 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips do not support QinQ configurations. They are limited to parsing only the first VLAN tag, any feature that require reading data after the VLAN tag, such as dhcp-snooping or igmp-snooping, will not function properly in QinQ setups. As a result, double-tagged DHCP or IGMP packets may be forwarded to incorrect switch ports and may lead to inaccurate MDB entries, causing multicast traffic to be flooded incorrectly.
6. The switch does not support ether-type 0x88a8 or 0x9100 (only 0x8100 is supported) and no tag-stacking support. Using these features will disable HW offload.
7. The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups.
8. The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups. It is possible to correctly snoop DHCP packets only for a single VLAN, but this requires that these DHCP messages get tagged with the correct VLAN tag using an ACL rule, for example, /interface ethernet switch acl add dst-l3-port=67-68 ip-protocol=udp mac-protocol=ip new-customer-vid=10 src-ports=switch1- cpu. DHCP Option 82 will not contain any information regarding VLAN-ID.
9. Currently, HW offloaded bridge support for the IPQ-PPE switch chip is still a work in progress. We recommend using, the default, non-HW offloaded bridge (enabled RSTP). When upgrading from older versions (before RouterOS v6.41), only the master-port configuration is conv erted. For each master-port a bridge will be created. VLAN configuration is not converted and should not be changed, check the Basic VLAN switching guide to be sure how VLAN switching should be configured for your device.
Bridge Hardware Offloading should be considered as port switching, but with more possible features. By enabling hardware offloading you are allowing a built-in switch chip to process packets using its switching logic. The diagram below illustrates that switching occurs before any software related action.

A packet that is received by one of the ports always passes through the switch logic first. Switch logic decides which ports the packet should be going to (most commonly this decision is made based on the destination MAC address of a packet, but there might be other criteria that might be involved based on the packet and the configuration). In most cases the packet will not be visible to RouterOS (only statistics will show that a packet has passed through), this is because the packet was already processed by the switch chip and never reached the CPU.

Though it is possible in certain situations to allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, this is usually called a packet forwarding to the switch CPU port (or the bridge interface in bridge VLAN filtering scenario). This allows the CPU to process the packet and lets the CPU to forward the packet. Passing the packet to the CPU port will give you the opportunity to route packets to different networks, perform traffic control and other software related packet processing actions. To allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, you need to make certain configuration changes depending on your needs and on the device you are using (most commonly passing packets to the CPU are required for VLAN filtering setups). Check the manual page for your specific device:

CRS1xx/2xx series switches Marvell Prestera switch chip features

non-CRS series switches

Certain bridge and Ethernet port properties are directly related to switch chip settings. Changing such properties can trigger a switch chip reset, temporarily disabling all Ethernet ports that are on the switch chip for the settings to take effect. This must be taken into account whenever changing properties in production environments. Such properties include DHCP Snooping, IGMP Snooping, VLAN filtering, L2MTU, Flow Control, and others. The exact settings that can trigger a switch chip reset depend on the device's model.

The CRS1xx/2xx series switches support multiple hardware offloaded bridges per switch chip. All other devices support only one hardware offloaded bridge per switch chip. Use the hw=yes/no parameter to select which bridge will use hardware offloading.

Example

Port switching with bridge configuration and enabled hardware offloading:

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes

Make sure that hardware offloading is enabled and active by checking the "H" flag:

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port print Flags: X-disabled, I-inactive, D-dynamic, H-hw-offload # INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON 0 H ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 1 H ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 2 H ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none 3 H ether5 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none

Port switching in RouterOS v6.41 and newer is done using the bridge configuration. Prior to RouterOS v6.41 port switching was done using the master-port property.

## <u>Bridge VLAN Filtering</u>

Bridge VLAN Filtering provides VLAN-aware Layer 2 forwarding and VLAN tag modifications within the bridge. This set of features makes bridge operation more similar to a traditional Ethernet switch and allows overcoming Spanning Tree compatibility issues compared to the configuration when VLAN interfaces are bridged. Bridge VLAN Filtering configuration is highly recommended to comply with STP (IEEE 802.1D), RSTP (IEEE 802.1W) standards and is mandatory to enable MSTP (IEEE 802.1s) support in RouterOS.

The main VLAN setting is vlan-filtering which globally controls VLAN-awareness and VLAN tag processing in the bridge. If vlan- filtering=no is configured, the bridge ignores VLAN tags, works in a shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) mode, and cannot modify VLAN tags of packets. Turning on vlan-filtering enables all bridge VLAN related functionality and independent-VLAN-learning (IVL) mode. Besides joining the ports for Layer2 forwarding, the bridge itself is also an interface therefore it has Port VLAN ID (pvid).

Currently, MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch and RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190, MT7621, MT7531, EN7523 switch chips (since RouterOS v7) are capable of using bridge VLAN filtering and hardware offloading at the same time, other devices will not be able to use the benefits of a built-in switch chip when bridge VLAN filtering is enabled. Other devices should be configured according to the method described in the Basic VLAN switching guide. If an improper configuration method is used, your device can cause throughput issues in your network.

### Bridge VLAN table

Bridge VLAN table represents per-VLAN port mapping with an egress VLAN tag action. tagged ports send out frames with a corresponding The VLAN ID tag. untagged ports remove a VLAN tag before sending out frames. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all or The admit- only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge vlan

Property Description

bridge (name; Default: n The bridge interface which the respective VLAN entry is intended for. one)

disabled (yes | no; Enables or disables Bridge VLAN entry. Default: no)

tagged (interfaces; Interfaces or interface list with a VLAN tag adding action in egress. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g. ta Default: none) gged=ether1,ether2.

untagged (interfaces; Interfaces or interface list with a VLAN tag removing action in egress. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g. Default: none) untagged=ether3,ether4.

vlan-ids (integer 1..4094 The list of VLAN IDs for certain port configuration. This setting accepts the VLAN ID range as well as comma-separated; Default: ) 1 values. e.g. vlan-ids=100-115,120,122,128-130.

The vlan-ids parameter can be used to specify a set or range of VLANs, but specifying multiple VLANs in a single bridge VLAN table entry should only be used for ports that are tagged ports. In case multiple VLANs are specified for access ports, then tagged packets might get sent out as untagged packets through the wrong access port, regardless of the PVID value.

Make sure you have added all needed interfaces to the bridge VLAN table when using bridge VLAN filtering.

For routing functions to work properly on the same device through ports that use bridge VLAN filtering, you will need to allow access to the bridge interface (this include a switch-cpu port when HW offloaded vlan-filtering is used). This can be done manually by adding the bridge interface itself to the VLAN table as a tagged port. Since RouterOS v7.16, this is done automatically when adding a VLAN interface to a bridge with vlan-filtering enabled (a dynamic entry with the comment "added by vlan on bridge" will appear under the /interface/bridge/vlan menu). More examples can be found in the inter-VLAN routing and Management port sections.

Since RouterOS 7.20, a dynamic tagged entry named "added by switch-cpu" will be added when the same VLAN ID spans across multiple switch chips or is used on both HW and SW ports.

When allowing access to the CPU, you are allowing access from a certain port to the actual router/switch, this is not always desirable. Make sure you implement proper firewall filter rules to secure your device when access to the CPU is allowed from a certain VLAN ID and port, use firewall filter rules to allow access to only certain services.

Improperly configured bridge VLAN filtering can cause security issues, make sure you fully understand how Bridge VLAN table works before deploying your device into production environments.

### Bridge port settings

Each bridge port have multiple VLAN related settings, that can change untagged VLAN membership, VLAN tagging/untagging behavior and packet filtering based on VLAN tag presence.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port

Property Description

frame-types (admit-all | admit-Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering only-untagged-and-priority-is set to yes. tagged | admit-only-vlan-tagged; Default: admit-all)

ingress-filtering (yes | no; Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN Default: yes) ID in the bridge VLAN table. Should be used with frame-types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.

pvid (integer 1..4094; Default: )1 Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.

tag-stacking (yes | no; Default: no Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN ) tag regardless if a VLAN tag already exists, packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the pvid value and will use EtherType that is specified in ether-type. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering i s set to yes.

### Bridge host table

Bridge host table allows monitoring learned MAC addresses. When vlan-filtering is enabled, it shows learned VLAN ID as well (enabled independent-VLAN-learning or IVL).

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge host print where !local Flags: X-disabled, I-invalid, D-dynamic, L-local, E-external # MAC-ADDRESS VID ON-INTERFACE BRIDGE 0 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:AA 300 ether3 bridge1 1 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:AB 400 ether4 bridge1

VLAN Example-Trunk and Access Ports

Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the device before VLANs are completely configured. If you need a management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no

Add bridge ports and specify pvid for access ports to assign their untagged traffic to the intended VLAN. Use frame-types setting to accept only tagged or untagged packets.

/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged

Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-only-untagged-and-priority- tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=200 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=400

In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering.

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).

/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

VLAN Example-Trunk and Hybrid Ports

Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured. If you need a

management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no

Add bridge ports and specify pvid on hybrid VLAN ports to assign untagged traffic to the intended VLAN.  Use frame-types setting to accept only tagged packets on ether2.

/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400

Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example egress VLAN tagging is done on ether6,ether7,ether8 ports too, making them into hybrid ports. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether7,ether8 vlan-ids=200 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether8 vlan-ids=300 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether7 vlan-ids=400

In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering.

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).

/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

You don't have to add access ports as untagged ports, because they will be added dynamically as an untagged port with the VLAN ID that is specified in pvid, you can specify just the trunk port as a tagged port. All ports that have the same pvid set will be added as untagged ports in a single entry. You must take into account that the bridge itself is a port and it also has a pvid value, this means that the bridge port also will be added as an untagged port for the ports that have the same pvid. You can circumvent this behavior by either setting different pvid on all ports (even the trunk port and bridge itself), or to use frame-type set to accept-only-vlan-tagged.

VLAN Example-InterVLAN Routing by Bridge

Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured. If you need a management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no

Add bridge ports and specify pvid for VLAN access ports to assign their untagged traffic to the intended VLAN. Use frame-types setting to accept only untagged packets.

/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged

Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example bridge1 interface is the VLAN trunk that will send traffic further to do InterVLAN routing. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=200 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=300 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=400

Configure VLAN interfaces on the bridge1 to allow handling of tagged VLAN traffic at routing level and set IP addresses to ensure routing between VLANs as planned.

/interface vlan add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN200 vlan-id=200 add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN300 vlan-id=300 add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN400 vlan-id=400

/ip address add address=20.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN200 add address=30.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN300 add address=40.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN400

In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).

/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using the L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details on L3 Hardware Offloading.

### Management access configuration

There are multiple ways to set up management access on a device that uses bridge VLAN filtering. Below are some of the most popular approaches to properly enable access to a router/switch. Start by creating a bridge without VLAN filtering enabled:

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no

Untagged access without VLAN filtering

In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the only requirement is to create an IP address on the bridge interface.

/ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1

Tagged access without VLAN filtering

In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with tagged traffic is desired, create a routable VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address on the VLAN interface.

/interface vlan add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99 /ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT

Tagged access with VLAN filtering

In case VLAN filtering is used and access with tagged traffic is desired, additional steps are required. In this example, VLAN 99 will be used to access the device. A VLAN interface on the bridge must be created and an IP address must be assigned to it.

/interface vlan add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99 /ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT

For example, if you want to allow access to the device from ports ether3, ether4, sfp-sfpplus1 using tagged VLAN 99 traffic, then you must add this entry to the VLAN table. Note that the bridge1 interface is also included in the tagged port list:

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99

After that you can enable VLAN filtering:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

Untagged access with VLAN filtering

In case VLAN filtering is used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the VLAN interface must use the same VLAN ID as the untagged port VLAN ID (pvid). Just like in the previous example, start by creating a VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address for the VLAN.

/interface vlan add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99 /ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT

For example, untagged ports ether2 and ether3 should be able to communicate with the VLAN 99 interface using untagged traffic. In order to achieve this, these ports should be configured with the pvid that matches the VLAN ID on management VLAN. Note that the bridge1 interface is a tagged port member, you can configure additional tagged ports if necessary (see the previous example).

/interface bridge port set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99 set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99 /interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99

After that you can enable VLAN filtering:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

Changing untagged VLAN for the bridge interface

In case VLAN filtering is used, it is possible to change the untagged VLAN ID for the bridge interface using the pvid setting. Note that creating routable VLAN interfaces and allowing tagged traffic on the bridge is a more flexible and generally recommended option.

First, create an IP address on the bridge interface.

/ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1

For example, untagged bridge1 traffic should be able to communicate with untagged ether2 and ether3 ports and tagged sfp-sfpplus1 port in VLAN 99. In order to achieve this, bridge1, ether2, ether3 should be configured with the same pvid and sfp-sfpplus1 added as a tagged member.

/interface bridge set [find name=bridge1] pvid=99 /interface bridge port set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99 set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99 /interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=bridge1,ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99

After that you can enable VLAN filtering:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

If the connection to the router/switch through an IP address is not required, then steps adding an IP address can be skipped since a connection to the router/switch through Layer2 protocols (e.g. MAC-telnet) will be working either way.

### VLAN Tunneling (QinQ)

Since RouterOS v6.43 the RouterOS bridge is IEEE 802.1ad compliant and it is possible to filter VLAN IDs based on Service VLAN ID (0x88a8) rather than Customer VLAN ID (0x8100). The same principles can be applied as with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN filtering (the same setup examples can be used). Below is a topology for a common Provider bridge:

In this example, R1, R2, R3, and R4 might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic by 802.1Q (CVID), but SW1 and SW2 needs isolate traffic between routers in a way that R1 is able to communicate only with R3, and R2 is only able to communicate with R4. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with an SVID and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by enabling the service tag 0x88a8, introduced by 802.1ad, on the bridge. Use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x88a8

In this setup, ether1 and ether2 are going to be access ports (untagged), use the pvid parameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200 add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300 add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1

Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300

When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.

Note, that if you are using the new EtherType/TPID 0x88a8 (service tag) and you also need a VLAN interface for your Service VLAN, you will also have to apply the use-service-tag parameter on the VLAN interface.

When ether-type=0x8100 is configured, the bridge checks the outer VLAN tag and sees if it is using EtherType 0x8100. If the bridge receives a packet with an outer tag that has a different EtherType, it will mark the packet as untagged. Since RouterOS only checks the outer tag of a packet, it is not possible to filter 802.1Q packets when the 802.1ad protocol is used.

Currently, only MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch are capable of hardware offloaded VLAN filtering using the Service tag, EtherType/TPID 0x88a8.

Devices with switch chip Marvell-98DX3257 (e.g. CRS354 series) do not support VLAN filtering on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for other VLAN types (0x88a8 and 0x9100).

### Tag stacking

Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to forcefully add a new VLAN tag over any existing VLAN tags, this feature can be used to achieve a CVID stacking setup, where a CVID (0x8100) tag is added before an existing CVID tag. This type of setup is very similar to Provider bridge setup, to the achieve the same setup but with multiple CVID tags (CVID stacking) we can use the same topology:

In this example R1, R2, R3, and R4 might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic, it can be 802.1ad, 802.1Q or any other type of traffic, but SW1 and SW2 needs isolate traffic between routers in a way that R1 is able to communicate only with R3, and R2 is only able to communicate with R4. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with a new CVID tag and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by selecting the proper EtherType, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x8100

In this setup, ether1 and ether2 will ignore any VLAN tags that are present and add a new VLAN tag, use the pvid parameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port and allow tag-stacking on these ports, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200 tag-stacking=yes add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300 tag-stacking=yes add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1

Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, you only need to specify the VLAN ID of the outer tag, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200 add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300

When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, which is required in order for the pvid parameter to have any effect, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.

MVRP

Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (MVRP) is a protocol based on Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) which allows to register attributes (VLAN IDs in case of MVRP) with other members of Bridged LAN.

An MRP application can make or withdraw declarations of attributes which result in registration or leaving of those attributes with other MRP participants.

Here's how it works.

MRP consists of two parts:

Applicant-responsible for sending declarations (or leaves). Its behavior can be configured on a per-port basis using the setting called mvrp- applicant-state, and per-VLAN using the mvrp-forbidden setting. Registrar-responsible for registering incoming declarations. Its configuration can be set per-port using the mvrp-registrar-state setting, and per-VLAN using the mvrp-forbidden setting.

Registration Propagation: Incoming registration on a bridge port dynamically makes that specific port a tagged VLAN member. Additionally, the attributes associated with this registration are spread to all active (forwarding) bridge ports as a declaration.

Declaration Operation: In case of MVRP, the configured VLAN's get declared on each port, but they will only get configured as members of those VLAN's when a declaration is received from the LAN (Registrar will register the VLAN). From the perspective of an end-station, a single declaration will be registered on each upstream port across the entire LAN. When another end-station declares the same attribute, a path of registrations will be made between the two (or more) end stations, see the picture below.

MVRP helps to dynamically propagate VLAN information throughout the bridged network and configure VLANs only on the needed ports. This makes the network efficient by avoiding unnecessary traffic flooding.

As noted before, MVRP is only active on ports that are forwarding. In case of MSTP declarations and registrations are made only if the port is forwarding in the MSTI in which VLAN is mapped.

The point-to-point ports speed up the point-to-point=yes process of registration (or leaving). Manually configuring can be advantageous for non- Ethernet interfaces.

Property Reference

Sub-menu: /interface bridge

Property Description

mvrp (yes no |; Enables MVRP for bridge. It ensures that the MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:21 is trapped and not forwarded, the vlan- Default: no) filtering must be enabled.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port

The port menu enables control over the applicant and registrar settings on a per-port basis.

Property Description

mvrp-applicant-state (non-participant | normal-participant; Default: n MVRP applicant options: ormal-participant) non-participant-port does not send any MRP messages; normal-participant-port participates normally in MRP exchanges.

mvrp-registrar-state (fixed | normal; Default: normal) MVRP registrar options:

fixed-port ignores all MRP messages, and remains Registered (IN) in all configured vlans. normal-port receives MRP messages and handles them according to the standard.

To monitor the currently declared and registered VLAN IDs, use the monitor command.

[admin@MikroTik] > interface/bridge/port monitor [find interface=sfp-sfpplus1] interface: sfp-sfpplus1 status: in-bridge port-number: 1 role: designated-port edge-port: no edge-port-discovery: yes point-to-point-port: yes external-fdb: no sending-rstp: yes learning: yes forwarding: yes actual-path-cost: 2000 hw-offload-group: switch1 declared-vlan-ids: 1,10,20-21 registered-vlan-ids: 1,10,20,30-33

Sub-menu: /interface bridge vlan

All ports that are members of static VLANs or dynamic untagged VLANs created by the port pvid setting are treated as "fixed." Meaning the registrar disregards all MRP messages and remains registered (IN) for those VLANs.

When VLAN is neither manually configured nor created by the port pvid setting, incoming registrations on a bridge port can dynamically designate that specific port as a tagged VLAN member. The mvrp-forbidden feature allows creating a list of ports that are restricted from registering into a specific VLAN ID.

VLANs that are static or dynamic will be declared by the applicants unless this functionality is disabled by the port's mvrp-applicant-state, or by VLAN's mvrp-forbidden setting.

Property Description

mvrp-forbidden (interfaces; Ports that ignore all MRP messages and remains Not Registered (MT), as well as disables applicant from Default: ) declaring specific VLAN ID.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge vlan mvrp

The MVRP attributes menu can be used to see internal MVRP attribute states, as specified in the IEEE 802.1Q-2011.

## <u>Fast Forward</u>

Fast Forward allows forwarding packets faster under special conditions. When Fast Forward is enabled, then the bridge can process packets even faster since it can skip multiple bridge-related checks, including MAC learning. Below you can find a list of conditions that MUST be met in order for Fast Forward to be active:

Bridge has fast-forward set to yes Bridge has only 2 running ports Both bridge ports support Fast Path, Fast Path is active on ports and globally on the bridge Bridge Hardware Offloading is disabled Bridge VLAN Filtering is disabled Bridge DHCP snooping is disabled unknown-multicast-flood is set to yes unknown-unicast-flood is set to yes broadcast-flood is set to yes MAC address for the bridge matches with a MAC address from one of the bridge slave ports horizon for both ports is set to none

Fast Forward disables MAC learning, this is by design to achieve faster packet forwarding. MAC learning prevents traffic from flooding multiple interfaces, but MAC learning is not needed when a packet can only be sent out through just one interface.

Fast Forward is disabled when hardware offloading is enabled. Hardware offloading can achieve full wire-speed performance when it is active since it will use the built-in switch chip (if such exists on your device), fast forward uses the CPU to forward packets. When comparing throughput results, you would get such results: Hardware offloading > Fast Forward > Fast Path > Slow Path.

It is possible to check how many packets where processed by Fast Forward:

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge settings> pr use-ip-firewall: no use-ip-firewall-for-vlan: no use-ip-firewall-for-pppoe: no allow-fast-path: yes bridge-fast-path-active: yes bridge-fast-path-packets: 0 bridge-fast-path-bytes: 0 bridge-fast-forward-packets: 16423 bridge-fast-forward-bytes: 24864422

If packets are processed by Fast Path, then Fast Forward is not active. Packet count can be used as an indicator of whether Fast Forward is active or not.

Since RouterOS 6.44 it is possible to monitor Fast Forward status, for example:

[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge monitor bridge1 state: enabled current-mac-address: B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7 root-bridge: yes root-bridge-id: 0x8000.B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7 root-path-cost: 0 root-port: none port-count: 2 designated-port-count: 2 fast-forward: yes

Disabling or enabling fast-forward will temporarily disable all bridge ports for settings to take effect. This must be taken into account whenever changing this property on production environments since it can cause all packets to be temporarily dropped.

## <u>IGMP/MLD Snooping</u>

The bridge supports IGMP/MLD snooping. It controls multicast streams and prevents multicast flooding on unnecessary ports. Its settings are placed in the bridge menu and it works independently in every bridge interface. Software-driven implementation works on all devices with RouterOS, but MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch, and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips also support IGMP/MLD snooping with hardware offloading. See more details on IGMP/MLD snooping manual.

## <u>DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82</u>

DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82 is supported by bridge. The DHCP Snooping is a Layer2 security feature, that limits unauthorized DHCP servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where known DHCP server resides and DHCP messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCP server messages will be dropped). The DHCP Option 82 is additional information (Agent Circuit ID and Agent Remote ID) provided by DHCP Snooping enabled devices that allow identifying the device itself and DHCP clients.

In this example, SW1 and SW2 are DHCP Snooping, and Option 82 enabled devices. First, we need to create a bridge, assign interfaces and mark trusted ports. Use these commands on SW1:

/interface bridge add name=bridge /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes

For SW2, the configuration will be similar, but we also need to mark ether1 as trusted, because this interface is going to receive DHCP messages with Option 82 already added. You need to mark all ports as trusted if they are going to receive DHCP messages with added Option 82, otherwise these messages will be dropped. Also, we add ether3 to the same bridge and leave this port untrusted, imagine there is an unauthorized (rogue) DHCP server. Use these commands on SW2:

/interface bridge add name=bridge /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 trusted=yes add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes add bridge=bridge interface=ether3

Then we need to enable DHCP Snooping and configure Option 82. Starting from RouterOS version 7.23, it is possible to configure custom Remote ID and Circuit ID values using predefined variables (such as BRIDGEMAC, HOSTNAME, INTERFACE, VID). See the dhcp-agent-circuit-id dhcp, -agent-remote-id properties for more details. In case your DHCP server does not support DHCP Option 82 or you do not implement any Option 82 related policies, this step is not mandatory. In this configuration example, we are using these commands on SW1 and SW2:

/interface bridge set [find where name="bridge"] dhcp-snooping=yes dhcp-agent-circuit-id="interface: \$(INTERFACE), vlan: \$(VID)" dhcp-agent-remote-id="ip: 192.168.88.1, identity: \$(HOSTNAME), mac: \$(BRIDGEMAC)"

Now both devices will analyze what DHCP messages are received on bridge ports. The SW1 is responsible for adding and removing the DHCP Option

82. The SW2 will limit rogue DHCP server from receiving any discovery messages and drop malicious DHCP server messages from ether3. Currently, MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch, and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips fully support hardware offloaded DHCP Snooping and Option 82. For CRS1xx and CRS2xx series switches it is possible to use DHCP Snooping along with VLAN switching, but then you need to make sure that DHCP packets are sent out with the correct VLAN tag using egress ACL rules. Other devices are capable of using DHCP Snooping and Option 82 features along with hardware offloading, but you must make sure that there is no VLAN-related configuration applied on the device, otherwise, DHCP Snooping and Option 82 might not work properly. See Bridge the Hardware Offloading section with supported features. Starting from RouterOS v7.17, DHCP snooping is supported with hardware offloading bonding interfaces.
## DHCPv6 Snooping / DHCPv6 Shield

The DHCPv6 Snooping is a Layer2 security feature that limits unauthorized DHCPv6 servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where known DHCPv6 server resides and DHCPv6 messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCPv6 server messages will be dropped, effectively implementing DHCPv6-Shield).

The DHCPv6 Option 18 (Interface-Id)and Option 37 (Remote-Id) are additional information provided by DHCPv6 Snooping enabled devices that allow identifying the device itself and DHCPv6 clients.

IPv6 allows more granular approach as well as flexibility with DHCPv6 Relay agent process. Functionally, these serve the exact same purpose as IPv4's Option 82: Option 18 acts as the Circuit ID (identifying the specific port/VLAN the client is attached to), and Option 37 acts as the Remote ID (identifying the relay agent or switch hardware itself).

Option 18 - identifies the specific interface (port) on which the client's message was received. It ensures the server knows exactly where the request came through so it can apply the correct policy.

Option 37 - identifies the relay agent (the switch or router) itself. Contains a unique caller ID (like the DUID—DHCP Unique Identifier). It tells the server which specific device in the network is talking to it.
