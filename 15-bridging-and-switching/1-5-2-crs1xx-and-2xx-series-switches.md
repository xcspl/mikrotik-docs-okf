## <u>Summary</u>

The Cloud Router Switch series are highly integrated switches with high-performance MIPS CPU and feature-rich packet processors. The CRS switches can be designed into various Ethernet applications including unmanaged switch, Layer 2 managed switch, carrier switch, and wireless/wired unified packet processing. See Cloud Router Switch configuration examples

|TPID-Tag Protocol Identifier DEI-Drop Eligible Indicator DSCP-Differentiated services Code Point Port Switching configured VLANs. Multiple switch groups Global Settings|Abbreviations and Explanations CVID-Customer VLAN id: inner VLAN tag id of the IEEE 802.1ad frame SVID-Service VLAN id: outer VLAN tag id of the IEEE 802.1ad frame IVL-Independent VLAN learning-learning/lookup is based on both MAC addresses and VLAN IDs. SVL-Shared VLAN learning-learning/lookup is based on MAC addresses-not on VLAN IDs. PCP-Priority Code Point: a 3-bit field which refers to the IEEE 802.1p priority Drop precedence-internal CRS switch QoS attribute used for packet enqueuing or dropping. To set up port switching on CRS1xx/2xx series switches, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page. Dynamic reserved VLAN entries (VLAN4091; VLAN4090; VLAN4089; etc.) are created in the CRS switch when switched port groups are added when a hardware offloaded bridge is created. These VLANs are necessary for internal operation and have lower precedence than user- The CRS1xx/2xx series switches allow you to use multiple bridges with hardware offloading, this allows you to easily isolate multiple switch groups. This can be done by simply creating multiple bridges and enabling hardware offloading. Multiple hardware offloaded bridge configuration is designed as a fast and simple port isolation solution, but it limits a part of the VLAN functionality supported by the CRS switch chip. For advanced configurations use one bridge within the CRS switch chip for all ports, configure VLANs, and isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration. CRS1xx/2xx series switches can run multiple hardware offloaded bridges with (R)STP enabled, but it is not recommended since the device is not designed to run multiple (R)STP instances on a hardware level. To isolate multiple switch groups and have (R)STP enabled you should isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration.|

The CRS switch chip is configurable from the /interface ethernet switch console menu.

Property Description

Name of the switch. name (string value; Default: switc h1)

The bridge type defines which VLAN tag is used as Lookup-VID. Lookup-VID serves as the VLAN key for all VLAN-based lookups. bridge-type (c ustomer-vid- used-as- lookup-vid | service-vid- used-as- lookup-vid; Default: custo mer-vid-used- as-lookup-vid)

unicast-fdb- timeout (time interval; Default: 5m)

override- existing- when-ufdb-full (yes | no; Default: no)

Globally enables or disables MAC level isolation. Once enabled, the switch will check the source and destination MAC address entries and their isolation-profile from the unicast forwarding table. By default, the switch will learn MAC addresses and place them into a promiscuous isolation profile. Other isolation profiles can be used when creating static unicast entries. If the source or destination MAC address is located on a promiscuous isolation profile, the packet is forwarded. If both source and destination MAC addresses are located on the same community1 or community2 isolation profile, the packet is forwarded. The packet is dropped when the source and destination MAC address isolation profile is isolated, or when the source and destination MAC address isolation profiles are from different communities (e.g. source MAC address is community1 and destination MAC address is community2). When MAC level isolation is globally disabled, the isolation is bypassed.

Whether to use service VLAN ID for 1:1 VLAN switching lookup.

Whether to use customer VLAN ID for 1:1 VLAN switching lookup.

Lookup mode for IPv4 multicast bridging.

dst-mac-and-vid-always-For all packet types lookup key is the destination MAC and VLAN ID. dst-ip-and-vid-for-ipv4 - For IPv4 packets lookup key is the destination IP and VLAN ID. For other packet types, the lookup key is the destination MAC and VLAN ID.

|the packet.||

## <u>Port Isolation/Leakage</u>

The CRS switches support flexible multi-level isolation features, which can be used for user access control, traffic engineering and advanced security and network management. The isolation features provide an organized fabric structure allowing user to easily program and control the access by port, MAC address, VLAN, protocol, flow, and frame type. The following isolation and leakage features are supported:

Port-level isolation MAC-level isolation VLAN-level isolation Protocol-level isolation Flow-level isolation Free combination of the above

Port-level isolation supports different control schemes on the source port and destination port. Each entry can be programmed with access control for either the source port or the destination port.

When the entry is programmed with source port access control, the entry is

applied to the ingress packets.

When the entry is programmed with destination port access control, the entry

is applied to the egress packets.

Port leakage allows bypassing egress VLAN filtering on the port. A leaky port is allowed to access other ports for various applications such as security, network control, and management. Note: When both isolation and leakage are applied to the same port, the port is isolated.

## <u>Trunking</u>

The Trunking in the Cloud Router Switches provides static link aggregation groups with hardware automatic failover and load balancing. IEEE802.3ad and IEEE802.1ax compatible Link Aggregation Control Protocol is not supported. Up to 8 Trunk groups are supported with up to 8 Trunk member ports per Trunk group.

## <u>Access Control List</u>

Access Control List contains of ingress policy and egress policy engines and allows configuration of up to 128 policy rules (limited by RouterOS). It is an advanced tool for wire-speed packet filtering, forwarding, shaping, and modifying based on Layer2, Layer3, and Layer4 protocol header field conditions.

See the Summary section for Access Control List supported Cloud Router Switch devices.
