Summary Voltage Temperature Fan control and behavior PoE-out consumption Limited manual fan-control option Brief description of the fan-control

Summary

Hardware that supports monitoring will display different information about hardware status, like temperature, voltage, current, fan-speed, etc.

Example on CCR1072-1G-8S+ device:

[admin@MikroTik] > system/health/print Columns: NAME, VALUE, TYPE # NAME VALUE TYPE 0 power-consumption 50.8 W 1 cpu-temperature 43 C 2 fan1-speed 5654 RPM 3 fan2-speed 5825 RPM 4 fan3-speed 5800 RPM 5 fan4-speed 5750 RPM 6 board-temperature1 29 C 7 board-temperature2 28 C 8 psu1-voltage 0 V 9 psu2-voltage 12.1 V 10 psu1-current 0 A 11 psu2-current 4.2 A

Intensive health monitoring on the CCR2004-16G-2S+PC device (from the console, winbox or SNMP) causes significant CPU load.

Voltage

Routers that support voltage monitoring will display supplied voltage value. In CLI/Winbox it will display volts. In scripts/API/SNMP this will be dV or value showed in CLI/Winbox

Note: Routers that have PEXT and PoE power input are calibrated using PEXT, as a result, value showed over PoE can be lower than input voltage due to

additional ethernet protection chains.

[admin@MikroTik] > system/health/print Columns: NAME, VALUE, TYPE # NAME VALUE TYPE 0 voltage 23.8 V 1 temperature 39 C

If old revision CRS112, CRS210 and CRS109 devices are powered with PoE-Health will show correct voltage only up to 26.7V. If higher voltage will be used-Health will show constant 16V.

Temperature

Routers that support temperature monitoring will display temperature reading. In CLI/Winbox it will display degrees Celsius. Using scripts/API/SNMP this value will be shown in CLI/Winbox multiplied by 10. There are various temperature sensors depending on the device. These sensors may refer to: cpu- temperature, pcb-temperature, sfp-temperature. Device tested ambient temperature range you can find in specification description at mikrotik.com. Tested ambient temperature range is temperature in which device can be physically located. It is not the same as temperature which reports system health monitor!

### Fan control and behavior

/system health set

Using this menu users will be able to control fan behaviour on TILE architecture devices.

Improved FAN stability starting from version 6.45.5.

There are three parameters that may affect fan behaviour: PoE-out consumption, SFP temperature and CPU temperature. As soon as one of the parameters exceeds the optimal value the, fans are started.

PoE-out consumption

If a device has PoE-out, then the fan RPM will change as described below:

PoE-out load RPM % of max FAN speed

0%..24% FAN speed 0%

25%..46% FAN speed 25%

47%..70% FAN speed 50%

71%..92% FAN speed 75%

93%.. FAN speed 100%

For devices with PWM fans, the speed will linearly increase or decrease from 9..88% (note: below 100W the fan RPM=0)

Limited manual fan-control option

Starting from RouterOS version 7.9 limited manual fan-control options have been added for CRS3xx, CRS5xx and CCR2xxx devices.

Starting from RouterOS version 7.14 limited manual fan-control is available for the CCR1036-8G-2S+-r2, CCR1036-12G-4S-r2 and CCR1016- 12S-1S+-r2 devices.

Fan behavior can be manipulated using the settings section of system health: /system health settings set

Available properties are described below:

Property Description

fan-full-speed-temp (integer [-273..65]; Def Sets the temperature value upon which the fan speed will be increased to the maximum possible rpm. ault: 65) Reads temperature from CPU, PHY, SWITCH and SFP and adjusts fan speed based on the component with the highest temperature.

fan-target-temp (integer [-273..65]; Default: Sets the target temperature for the hottest component. Based on this setting adjusts fan behavior to hold

58) temperatures in target range.

fan-min-speed-percent (integer [0..100]; De Sets the minimum percentage of fan speed thus not allowing fans to have a lower rpm than this value. fault: depends on FAN controller) *NOTE: the default value may vary based on FAN controller chip and/or specific model requirements. From RouterOS verson 7.14 default value is set to 12, all previous versions have 0.

fan-control-interval (integer [5..30]; Default: Sets the actual temperature data read interval to get temperature values from CPU, PHY, SWITCH and

30) SFP.
*NOTE: THIS SETTING DIRECTLY AFFECTS CPU USAGE

cpu-overtemp-check (yes | no; Default: no) Enables/disables CPU overtemperature monitoring.

(Available for ARM/ARM64 devices)

cpu-overtemp-threshold (integer [0..105]; Maximum temperature before triggering an overtemperature protection. Default: 105)

cpu-overtemp-startup-delay (time; Default: Delay after startup before enabling overtemperature monitoring. 1m)

Brief description of the fan-control

If at least one of the internal measured (CPU, SFP, Switch, Board etc.) temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will start to spin. The higher the temperature, the faster the fans will spin. For devices with PWM fans, as the internal measured temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will linearly increase their RPM to try to keep the temperature at fan-target-temp if possible and will get to their Max RPM when the temperature is equal or exceeds fan -full-speed-temp.  For devices with DC fans, as the internal measured temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will start spinning but at a higher minimum RPM by default. This may result in cooling the device to the point where the fans turn-off completely if fan-min-speed-percent is set to 0%, while with the default value of 12% fans will never go to a full stop therefore reducing the noise and On/Off peaks that may occur. The temperature then may slowly increase to fan-target-temp and the fans will turn on again. Currently, there is one exception. The S+RJ10 modules have a temperature threshold of 65C before they trigger the fans. Since it's a higher temperature threshold, the fans will start spinning at a higher initial speed to cool the device. All the above mentioned functionality is directly related to the fan-control-interval parameter value as it will determine how often FAN controller monitors all sensor data and triggers changes in fan-control.

PWM and DC fans react to fan-control differently. While PWM fans will increase/decrease their RPM in a linear way the DC fans have only few possible speed ratings at which they may operate.

All readings are approximate and may not be 100% precise. Their purpose is to ~inform users about possible/upcoming failures.
