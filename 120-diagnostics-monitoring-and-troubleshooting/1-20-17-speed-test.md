# Speed Test

Introduction General interface properties Configuration Example

## Introduction

The Speed Test is an easy test tool for measuring ping, jitter, TCP and UDP throughput from one MikroTik device, to another. The "speed-test" command is based on the Ping Tool and Bandwidth Test. In order to use this command-Bandwidth test server needs to be accessible.

## General interface properties

The speed-test is based on five configurable properties:

address-IP address of host; connection-count-If a device has more than 20 cores-core count will be used (default is 20); password-Password for the remote device; test-duration-Duration for each test (By default: 5 tests * 10 sec duration + 1sec pause between each test = 55sec); user-Remote device username;

## Configuration Example

Bandwidth and speed tests should be conducted through the devices, not on them to ensure real-life simulation and not to overload the CPU on the devices under testing,(DUT) due to the traffic generating process.

To run a simple test from device A (192.168.88.1) to device B (192.168.88.2):

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/speed-test address=192.168.88.1 status: done time-remaining: 0s ping-min-avg-max: 541us / 609us / 3.35ms jitter-min-avg-max: 0s / 76us / 2.76ms loss: 0% (0/100) tcp-download: 921Mbps local-cpu-load:30% tcp-upload: 920Mbps local-cpu-load:30% remote-cpu-load:25% udp-download: 917Mbps local-cpu-load:6% remote-cpu-load:21% udp-upload: 916Mbps local-cpu-load:20% remote-cpu-load:6%

If any of device CPU utilization during test reaches 100% warning message will appear:

[admin@MikroTik]] > /tool/speed-test address=192.168.88.1 ;;; results can be limited by cpu, note that traffic generation/termination performance might not be representative of forwarding performance status: done time-remaining: 0s ping-min-avg-max: 541us / 609us / 3.35ms jitter-min-avg-max: 0s / 76us / 2.76ms loss: 0% (0/100) tcp-download: 721Mbps local-cpu-load:78% tcp-upload: 820Mbps local-cpu-load:100% remote-cpu-load:84% udp-download: 906Mbps local-cpu-load:10% remote-cpu-load:54% udp-upload: 895Mbps local-cpu-load:55% remote-cpu-load:12%

"test-duration" parameter allows changing the duration of all of the 5 tests:

) Ping test with 50ms delay ) TCP receive ) TCP send

) UDP receive ) UDP send
