# Bandwidth Test

## Summary

Sub-menu: /tool Packages required: system

The Bandwidth Tester can be used to measure the throughput to another MikroTik router (either wired or wireless) and thereby help to discover network "bottlenecks".

The TCP test uses the standard TCP protocol with acknowledgments and follows the TCP algorithm on how many packets to send according to latency, dropped packets, and other features in the TCP algorithm. Please review the TCP protocol for details on its internal speed settings and how to analyze its behavior. Statistics for throughput are calculated using the entire size of the TCP data stream. As acknowledgments are an internal working of TCP, their size and usage of the link are not included in the throughput statistics. Therefore this statistic is not as reliable as the UDP statistic when estimating throughput.

The UDP tester sends 110% or more packets than currently reported as received on the other side of the link. To see the maximum throughput of a link, the packet size should be set for the maximum MTU allowed by the links which is usually 1500 bytes. There is no acknowledgment required by UDP; this implementation means that the closest approximation of the throughput can be seen.

Up to RouterOS version 6.44beta39 Bandwidth Test used only single CPU core and reached its limits when core was 100% loaded. Bandwidth Test uses all available bandwidth (by default) and may impact network usability.

Bandwidth Test uses a lot of resources. If you want to test real throughput of a router, you should run bandwidth test through the tested router not from or to it. To do this you need at least 3 routers connected in chain: the Bandwidth Server, the router being tested and the Bandwidth Client.

If you use UDP protocol then Bandwidth Test counts IP header+UDP header+UDP data. In case if you use TCP then Bandwidth Test counts only TCP data (TCP header and IP header are not included).

## Bandwidth Test Server

Sub-menu: /tool bandwidth-server

Property Description

allocate-udp-ports-from (integer 1000..64000; Default: 2000) Beginning of UDP port range

authenticate (yes | no; Default: yes) Communicate only with authenticated clients

enabled (yes | no; Default: yes) Defines whether bandwidth server is enabled or not

max-sessions (integer 1..1000; Default: 100) Maximal simultaneous test count

Example

Bandwidth Server:

[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> print enabled: yes authenticate: yes allocate-udp-ports-from: 2000 max-sessions: 100 [admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server>

Active sessions:

[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server session> print # CLIENT PROTOCOL DIRECTION USER 0 35.35.35.1 udp send admin 1 25.25.25.1 udp send admin 2 36.36.36.1 udp send admin [admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server session>

To enable bandwidth-test server without client authentication:

[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> set enabled=yes authenticate=no [admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> print enabled: yes authenticate: no allocate-udp-ports-from: 2000 max-sessions: 100 [admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server>

## Bandwidth Test Client

Sub-menu: /tool bandwidth-test

Property Description

address (IP address | IP address of host IPv6 prefix[%interface]; Default:)

direction (both | receive | Direction of data flow transmit; Default: receive)

duration (time; Default: ) Duration of the test

interval (time: 20ms..5s; Delay between reports (in seconds) Default: 1s)

local-tx-speed (integer 0.. Transfer test maximum speed (bits per second) 18446744073709551615; Default: )

local-udp-tx-size (integer: Local transmit packet size in bytes

28..64000) password (string; Default: "" Password for the remote user ) protocol (udp | tcp; Default: Protocol to use udp) random-data (yes | no; If random-data is set to yes, the payload of the bandwidth test packets will have incompressible random data stream Default: no)
so that links that use data compression will not distort the results (this is CPU intensive and random-data should be set to no for low speed CPUs)

remote-tx-speed (integer Receive test maximum speed (bits per second)

0.. 18446744073709551615; Default: ) remote-udp-tx-size (integer Remote transmit packet size in bytes : 28..64000) connection-count (integer Number of TCP connections to use
1..255; Default:) user (string; Default: "") Remote user
Example

To run 15-second long bandwidth-test to the 10.0.0.32 host sending and receiving 1000-byte UDP packets and using username admin to connect:

[admin@MikroTik] /tool> bandwidth-test 10.0.0.32 duration=15s \ \... direction=both local-udp-tx-size=1000 protocol=udp \ \... remote-udp-tx-size=1000 user=admin status: done testing duration: 15s tx-current: 272.8Mbps tx-10-second-average: 200.3Mbps tx-total-average: 139.5Mbps rx-current: 169.6Mbps rx-10-second-average: 164.8Mbps rx-total-average: 117.0Mbps lost-packets: 373 random-data: no direction: both tx-size: 1000 rx-size: 1000 [admin@MikroTik] /tool>

Link-local IPv6 example:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool bandwidth-test fe80::34:23ff:fe6a:570c%local status: running duration: 5s rx-current: 23.9Mbps rx-10-second-average: 15.1Mbps rx-total-average: 15.1Mbps lost-packets: 0 random-data: no direction: receive rx-size: 1500
