# Dynamic DNS

## Introduction

/tool dns-update

Standards: RFC 2136, RFC 3007

Dynamic DNS Update Tool gives a way to keep the domain name pointing to a dynamic IP address. It works by sending a domain name system update requests to the name server, which has a zone to be updated. Secure DNS updates are also supported.

The DNS update tool supports only one algorithm-hmac-md5. It's the only proposed algorithm for signing DNS messages.

DNS update tool works only with the BIND server, it will not work with DynDNS, EveryDNS, or any other similar service.

## Properties

|Property||Description|
|---|---|---|
|address (IP; Default: )||Defines the IP address associated with the domain name.|
|dns-server (IP; Default: )||DNS server to send updates to.|
|key (string; Default: )||Authorization key to access the server.|
|key-name (string; Default: )||Authorization key name (like a username) to access the server.|
|name (string; Default: )||Name to attach with the IP address.|
|ttl (integer; Default: )||Time to live for the item (in seconds).|
|zone (string; Default: )||DNS zone where to update the domain name in.|

The system clock time on your router can't differ from the DNS server's time by more than 5 minutes. Otherwise, the DNS server will ignore this request.

## Example

To tell 23.34.45.56 DNS server to (re)associate mydomain name in the myzone.com zone with 68.42.14.4 IP address specifying that the name of the key is dns-update-key and the actual key updates:

[admin@MikroTik] tool> dns-update dns-server=23.34.45.56 name=mydomain \ \... zone=myzone.com address=68.42.14.4 key-name=dns-update-key key=update
