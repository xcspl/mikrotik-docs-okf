# IP Scan

Summary Quick Example

## Summary

IP Scan tool allows a user to scan networks based on some network prefix or by setting an interface to listen to. Either way, the tool collects certain data from the network:

address-IP address of network device; mac-address-MAC address of network device; time-response time of seen network device when found; DNS-DNS name of a network device; SNMP-SNMP name of the device; NET-BIOS  - NET-BIOS name of device if advertised by the device;

When using IP scan tool user must choose what they want to scan for:

certain IPv4 prefix-the tool will attempt to scan all the IP addresses or addresses set; the interface of the router-the tool will attempt to listen to packets that are "passing by" and attempt to compile results when something is found;

There is a possibility to set both but then results may be inconclusive!

## Quick Example

In the following example, we will scan the devices on 10.155.126.0/24 network:

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool ip-scan address-range=10.155.126.1-10.155.126.255 Columns: ADDRESS, MAC-ADDRESS, TIMe, SNMP ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS TIM SNMP

In example above you can see that second message was added on sep/15 current year (year is not added) and the last message was added today so only the time is displayed. Print command accepts several parameters that allows to detect new log entries, print only necessary messages and so on. For example following command will print all log messages where one of the topics is info and will detect new log entries until Ctrl+C is pressed. [admin@MikroTik] /log > print follow where topics~".info" 12:52:24 script,info hello from script In this example it will print only the dhcp info messages:|

## Logging configuration

Sub-menu level: **/system logging**

Property Description

action (name; Default: memory) specifies one of the system default actions or user specified action listed in actions menu

prefix (string; Default: ) prefix added at the beginning of log messages

regex (string; Default: ) regex which will be used in order to match or not match message. If the regex is not matched, then even if topic is configured to be logged, but log message does not match regex, action will not be performed.

topics (client,amt,async,backup,bfd,bgp,bridge,calc,caps,certificate,clock,container,critical,ddns,dhcp,disk,dns, log all messages that falls into dot1x,dude,e-mail,error,event,evpn,fetch,firewall,gps,gsm,health,hotspot,igmp-proxy,info,interface,ipsec,iscsi, specified topic or list of topics. isdn,kvm,l2tp,lora,ldp,lte,mme,manager,mqtt,mpls,mvrp,natpmp,netwatch,ntp,ospf,ovpn,packet,pim,poe-out, ppp,pppoe,pptp,ptp,queue,radvd,radius,raw,read,rip,rsvp,script,sertcp,simulator,smb,snmp,socksify,ssh,sstp,'!' character can be used before topic system,state,store,telephony,tftp,timer,tr069,update,upnp,ups,vpls,vrrp,warning,watchdog,web-proxy,wiliot, to exclude messages falling under wireguard,wireless,write,zerotier; Default: info) this topic. For example, we want to log NTP debug info without too much details:

/system logging add topics=ntp,debug,!packet

Actions

Property Description

cef-event-delimiter (string; Default: \r\n) option helps remote syslog to distinguish between individual events within sent batch

disk-file-count (integer [1..65535]; Default: )2 specifies number of files used to store log messages, applicable only if action=disk

disk-file-name (string; Default: log) name of the file used to store log messages, applicable only if action=disk

disk-stop-on-full (yes|no; Default: no)

email-start-tls (yes | no; Default: no)

email-to (string; Default: )

email-cc (string; Default: )

memory-lines (integer [1..65535]; Default: 1000)

memory-stop-on-full (yes|no; Default: no)

name (string; Default: )

remember (yes|no; Default: )

remote-log-format (cef, default, syslog; Default: default)

whether to stop to save log messages to disk after the specified disk-lines-per-file and disk-file-count number is reached, applicable only if action=disk

Whether to use tls when sending email, applicable only if action=email

email address where logs are sent, applicable only if action=email

email address where logs are sent as CC, applicable only if action=email

number of records in local memory buffer, applicable only if action=memory

whether to stop to save log messages in local buffer after the specified memory- lines number is reached

name of an action. When target=memory, this name also serves as the identifier for a specific memory buffer. Multiple actions with target=memory can be created, each storing logs in its own separate buffer.

whether to keep log messages, which have not yet been displayed in console, applicable if action=echo

Format for logs to be sent to remote instance:

cef-logs are sent in CEF format; default-logs are sent as it is; syslog-logs are sent in BSD-syslog format

remote logging server's IP/IPv6 address and UDP port, applicable if action=remote

protocol for remote logging messages, TCP and TLS only works with CEF remote- log-format, for syslog it will always use UDP, even if TCP / TLS is set

source address used when sending packets to remote server

remote-port (IP/IPv6 Address[:Port]; Default: 0.0.0.0:514)

remote-protocol (tcp / udp / tls; Default: udp)

Severity level indicator defined in RFC 3164:

Emergency: system is unusable Alert: action must be taken immediately Critical: critical conditions Error: error conditions Warning: warning conditions Notice: normal but significant condition Informational: informational messages Debug: debug-level messages

Timelog format for messages

storage facility or target of log messages

disk-logs are saved to the hard drive echo-logs are displayed on the console screen email-logs are sent by email memory-logs are stored in local memory buffer or multiple seperate buffers (RAM files). remote-logs are sent to remote host

Set VRF on which the remote logging is making outgoing connections, applicable only if target=remote. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.19.

Either to check server certificate when using TLS type of logging for remote action.

||single default memory log.|Create seperate memory logging buffers Just like having different text files for different notes, these separate memory buffers allow you to direct specific types of log messages (based on topics) into distinct storage areas in memory. Isolation: Logs sent to buffer_A are completely separate from logs sent to buffer_B. Independent Viewing: You can view the contents of just one buffer at a time using /log print where buffer=buffer_name. Targeted Clearing: You can clear the contents of one specific buffer using /system logging action clear action=buffer_name without affecting the logs stored in any other memory buffer.

## Examples

### Create seperate memory logging buffers

Create new memory logging buffers, which will store specified logs seperately from default memory logs.

/system logging action add name=dhcpMemoryLog target=memory memory-lines=300 /system logging action add name=wirelessLog target=memory memory-lines=500

Assign topics to created buffers. This rule sends all DHCP logs to dhcpMemoryLog, and wireless logs to wirelessLog buffer.

/system logging add topics=dhcp action=dhcpMemoryLog /system logging add topics=wireless action=wirelessLog

View content of each buffer seperately

# View only DHCP related logs stored in its dedicated buffer /log print where buffer=dhcpMemoryLog

# View only non-info Wireless logs stored in its dedicated buffer /log print where buffer=wirelessLog

Clear all memory logs from specifc memory buffer

/system logging action clear action=dhcpMemoryLog

### Logging to file

To log everything to file, add new log action:

/system logging action add name=file target=disk disk-file-name=log

and then make everything log using this new action:

/system logging add action=file

You can log only errors there by issuing command:

/system logging add topics=error action=file

This will log into files log.0.txt and log.1.txt.

You can specify maximum size of file in lines by specifying disk-lines-per-file. <file>.0.txt is active file were new logs are going to be appended and once it size will reach maximum it will become <file>.1.txt, and new empty <file>.0.txt will be created.

You can log into USB flashes or into MicroSD/CF (on Routerboards) by specifying it's directory name before file name. For example, if you have accessible usb flash as usb1 directory under /files, you should issue following command:

/system logging action add name=usb target=disk disk-file-name=usb1/log

Logging entries from files will be stored back in the memory after reboot.
