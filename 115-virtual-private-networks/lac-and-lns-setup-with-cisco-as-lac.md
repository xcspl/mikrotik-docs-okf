# LAC and LNS setup with Cisco as LAC

Overview Configuration Client LAC LNS Status Check Session Establishment

## Overview

LAC/LNS setup or otherwise known as Virtual Private DialUp Network (VPDN) allows long-distance point-to-point connection between remote dial-up users and private networks.

Dial-up client uses PPPOE to connect to a L2TP access concentrator (LAC), LAC determines that session should be forwarded through a IP network to the L2TP Network Server (LNS), creates L2TP tunnel and forwards PPP frames to the server where client is authenticated and session established (see diagram below).

At the time of writing this article RouterOS cannot be used in LAC role. For this reason article will demonstrate how to set up very basic network with RouterOS as LNS and Cisco router as LAC.

## Configuration

We will be using simple configuration to demonstrate very basics of VPDN setup. Lets assume that LAC will forward to the LNS clients with FQDN name containing mt.lv domain.

Client

For the sake of simplicity lets assume that client is RouterOS router:

/interface pppoe-client add interface=ether1 user=good_worker@mt.lv password=strongpass

LAC

Lets assume that client is connected to the GigabitEthernet1 port and IP address of the LNS server is 10.155.101.231

aaa new-model ! aaa authentication ppp default local ! vpdn enable vpdn aaa attribute nas-ip-address vpdn-nas vpdn search-order domain dnis ! vpdn-group LAC request-dialin protocol l2tp domain mt.lv initiate-to ip 10.155.101.231 source-ip 10.155.101.216 local name LAC l2tp tunnel password 0 tunnelpass ! bba-group pppoe MAIN-BBA virtual-template 1 ! interface GigabitEthernet1 pppoe enable group MAIN-BBA ! interface Virtual-Template1 description pppoe MAIN-BBA no ip address no peer default ip address ppp mtu adaptive ppp authentication chap !

Note that this setup does not authenticate client nor locally nor via RADIUS, does not actually check domain name, does not control L2 access for the sake of simplicity. If you want to use those features refer to Cisco configuration manuals.

LNS

On the LNS we need to enable L2TP server and set up method to authenticate the L2TP connection from the LAC.

/interface l2tp-server server set enabled=yes /ppp l2tp-secret add address=10.155.101.216/32 secret=tunnelpass

Now the actual user authentication. In this case we will be using local authentication method for the sake of simplicity.

/ip pool add name=pool0 ranges=192.168.99.2-192.168.99.99 /ppp profile set default local-address=192.168.99.1 remote-address=pool0 /ppp secret add name=good_worker@mt.lv password=strongpass

## Status Check

On the LNS you can see all successfully connected clients by checking l2tp server interfaces or checking active ppp connections:

[admin@CHR_v6_bgp] /interface l2tp-server> print Flags: X-disabled, D-dynamic, R-running # NAME USER MTU CLIENT-ADDRESS UPTIME ENCODING 0 DR <l2tp-... good_worker@mt.lv 1450 10.155.101.216 6h13m49s

[admin@CHR_v6_bgp] /ppp active> print Flags: R-radius # NAME SERVICE CALLER-ID ADDRESS UPTIME ENCODING 0 good_worker@mt.lv l2tp 10.155.101.216 192.168.99.2 6h15m57s

On the LAC we can also see active client sessions and active L2TP tunnel between LAC and LNS:

csrLAC#show vpdn

## Session Establishment

Lets look closely on how clients sessions gets authenticated and established over the LAC.

Client initiates PPPoE call LAC and Client begins LCP negotiation after CHAP has been negotiated, LAC sends CHAP challenge Client sends CHAP response LAC checks whether client session should be forwarded to the LNS based on received domain name. Check can be done locally or using RADIUS server. Client also can be authenticated here before forwarding session. LAC brings up an L2TP tunnel LNS checks if the LAC is allowed to open a tunnel and run the authentication process. The Tunnel is up and ready to forward VPDN sessions. LAC forwards negotiated with the client LCP options, username and password to the LNS LNS authenticates the client locally or using RADIUS and sends CHAP response IP Control Protocol (IPCP) phase is performed, IP addresses and routes are installed. At this point sessions is considered established.
