# Moving your RAID array to a different device

It is possible to move your RAID array from one device to another.

In this example we are using a RAID 5 array on an RDS2216 consisting of 4 members.

First, on the "new" device, create a RAID array with the same number of members and assign the member slots:

```ros
# New device
/disk/add raid-device-count=4 raid-type=5 type=raid slot=raid5
```

```ros
# New device - assign roles to the (currently empty) slots
/disk/set raid-master=raid5 raid-role=0 nvme1
/disk/set raid-master=raid5 raid-role=1 nvme2
/disk/set raid-master=raid5 raid-role=2 nvme3
/disk/set raid-master=raid5 raid-role=3 nvme4
```

On the "old" device, eject the disks you want to switch to the "new" device:

```ros
# Old device
/disk/eject nvme1
/disk/eject nvme2
/disk/eject nvme3
/disk/eject nvme4
```

Remove the disks from the "old" device and insert them into the assigned slots in the "new" one. RouterOS will automatically detect the RAID superblock and mount the array without any additional input.
