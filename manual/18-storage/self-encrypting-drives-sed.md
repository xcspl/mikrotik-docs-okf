# Self-encrypting drives (SED)

:::info
This feature requires the [Storage](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/index.md) package.
:::

For using SED, drives have to be [Opal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Storage_Specification)-compliant. Please consult the drive manufacturer's documentation to find out if a particular drive supports this feature before buying drives.

SED is not supported on setups using USB bridges; the disk must be attached directly (SATA or NVMe).

RouterOS marks supported drives with the **o (TCG-OPAL supported, encryption not active)** or **O (TCG-OPAL supported and encryption active)** flags:

```ros
/disk/print
Flags: B - BLOCK-DEVICE; M, F - FORMATTING; o - TCG-OPAL-SELF-ENCRYPTION-SUPPORTED (inactive); O - TCG-OPAL-SELF-ENCRYPTION-SUPPORTED (active)
Columns: SLOT, MODEL, SERIAL, INTERFACE, SIZE, FREE, FS, RAID-MASTER
#     SLOT   MODEL                  SERIAL           INTERFACE                   SIZE             FREE  FS    RAID

```

To enable self-encryption on a drive, set `self-encryption-password`:

```ros
/disk/set sata1 self-encryption-password=securepassword
```

Once set, the drive locks itself on power loss and requires the password every time it's connected; RouterOS supplies it automatically (the flag changes to `O`).

To disable self-encryption, unset the password:

```ros
/disk/unset sata1 self-encryption-password
```

or:

```ros
/disk/set sata1 !self-encryption-password
```
