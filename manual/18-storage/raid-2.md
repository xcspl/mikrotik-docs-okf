# RAID

:::info
This feature requires the [Storage](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md) package.
:::

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) technology allows storing data on multiple drives - improving data transfer performance, data protection or both by combining them into logical units.

In the case of a RAID disk failure, a rebuild begins automatically once the failed drive is replaced.

RouterOS supports software RAID levels 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, linear, and nested RAID.

## Configuration example (RAID6)

This is an example on how to configure RAID. It will be the same procedure for most RAID types

Create the RAID block device (in this example, RAID 6)

```ros
add raid-device-count=20 raid-type=6 slot=raid1 type=raid
```

Add drives to this raid

```ros
set nvme1 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0
set nvme2 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=1
set nvme3 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=2
set nvme4 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=3
set nvme5 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=4
set nvme6 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=5
set nvme7 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=6
set nvme8 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=7
set nvme9 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=8
set nvme10 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=9
set nvme11 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=10
set nvme12 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=11
set nvme13 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=12
set nvme14 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=13
set nvme15 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=14
set nvme16 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=15
set nvme17 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=16
set nvme18 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=17
set nvme19 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=18
set nvme20 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=19

```

Format the RAID block device

```ros
/disk> format raid1 file-system=ext4 
```

And the result should look similar to this

```ros
21 BM        type=raid slot="raid1" slot-default="" parent=none uuid="f457bc79-7408-489b-8850-85923e900452" fs=ext4 model="RAID6 2-parity-disks" 
             size=17 283 541 893 120 free=17 283 538 190 336 raid-type=6 raid-device-count=20 raid-max-component-size=none raid-chunk-size=1M raid-master=none 
             raid-state="clean" nvme-tcp-export=no iscsi-export=no nfs-sharing=no smb-sharing=no media-sharing=no media-interface=none 

```

:::warning
Avoid using multiple partitions on a single physical disk in multiple RAID arrays. Using the same physical disk in multiple RAID arrays can result in low performance.

## Example: RAID check

It is extremely important to monitor your RAID array for failures. There are multiple ways to do it, but the simplest way is to create a script that sends an e-mail whenever a RAID member has failed. You can use the following script as a working example:

```routeros
/system/scheduler
add interval=30s name=MRaidHealthCheckCall on-event=MraidHealthCheck policy=ftp,read,write,policy,test,sniff start-time=startup
/system/script
add dont-require-permissions=no name=MraidHealthCheck owner=admin policy=ftp,read,write,policy,test,sniff source=":global CheckRAID;\
    \n:local sysadmin; \
    \n\
    \n:set  \$sysadmin \"<servername@domain.tld>\";\
    \n\
    \n:local temp [/disk/print count-only where raid-member-failed];\
    \n:if ( \$temp > 0 ) do={\
    \n   :if ( \$CheckRAID < 1 ) do={\
    \n      /log/info message=\"ERROR: RAID has failed!\";\
    \n      /tool/e-mail/send to= \$sysadmin subject=([/system/identity/get name].\" RAID failed\") body=(\"Go check it! Value: \".\$temp);\
    \n      :set \$CheckRAID 7;\
    \n      :delay 5s;\
    \n    }\
    \n   }       \
    \n   :if ( \$CheckRAID > 0 ) do={\
    \n      :set \$CheckRAID ( \$CheckRAID -1 );\
    \n   }\
    \n"
```

You will also need to configure your RouterOS device's e-mail server settings:

```routeros
/tool/e-mail
set from=<raidcheck@domain.tld> port=587 server=smtp.domain.com tls=starttls
```

:::warning

Make sure you configure your e-mail server's settings under `/tool/e-mail` and change the e-mail address in the script above with the values that match your e-mail server's settings.

## RAID types

### RAID 0

All data is written evenly over all disks in this RAID, this configuration does not provide any fault tolerance but provides best performance.

![RAID 0 diagram: data striped across disks](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-01.webp)

### RAID 1

The same data is written to all drives (data is mirrored), this configuration provides best fault tolerance, but performance-wise write speeds will be equal to the slowest disk used in the array.

![RAID 1 diagram: data mirrored between disks](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-02.webp)

### RAID 4

Block-level data is striped across data disks, with parity bits stored on a dedicated disk. Performance will be limited to the parity writing speed.

![RAID 4 diagram: block-level striping with dedicated parity disk](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-03.webp)

### RAID 5

Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. It can be recovered from 1 disk failure.

![RAID 5 diagram: block-level striping with distributed parity](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-04.webp)

### RAID 6

Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. It can be recovered from 2 disk failures.

![RAID 6 diagram: block-level striping with double distributed parity](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-05.webp)

### RAID Linear

Data is appended over multiple disks combining them into a single large disk. Provides no redundancy and is limited to the single disk read/write speed.

![RAID linear diagram: data appended across disks](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-06.webp)

### Nested RAID

Combination of multiple RAID configurations into another RAID. For example RAID 10 (RAID 1+0) combines disk mirroring (RAID 1) and disk striping (RAID 0)

![Nested RAID diagram: RAID 1+0 combining mirroring and striping](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/img/raid-07.webp)

### Configuration example

In this example I'm using 10 SSD drives and configuring in RAID (RAID 1+0)

Create a RAID 0 block

```ros
add raid-device-count=5 raid-type=0 slot=raid10 type=raid
```

Create five RAID 1 blocks, each containing 2 devices and add them to set the master-raid to the previously created RAID 0 block (name=raid10)

```ros
add raid-device-count=2 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=0 raid-type=1 slot=raid0 type=raid
add raid-device-count=2 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=1 raid-type=1 slot=raid1 type=raid
add raid-device-count=2 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=2 raid-type=1 slot=raid2 type=raid
add raid-device-count=2 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=3 raid-type=1 slot=raid3 type=raid
add raid-device-count=2 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=4 raid-type=1 slot=raid4 type=raid
```

Add drives to each RAID block

```ros
set nvme1 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=0
set nvme3 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0
set nvme5 raid-master=raid2 raid-role=0
set nvme7 raid-master=raid3 raid-role=0
set nvme9 raid-master=raid4 raid-role=0

set nvme2 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=1
set nvme4 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=1
set nvme6 raid-master=raid2 raid-role=1
set nvme8 raid-master=raid3 raid-role=1
set nvme10 raid-master=raid4 raid-role=1

```

After this format, the raid10 block

```ros
format raid10 file-system=ext4 
```

After formatting you should see the free space and use the block

```ros
23 BM        type=raid slot="raid10" slot-default="" parent=none uuid="ec3344f4-1662-49ab-b899-db1aaa217b0f" fs=ext4 model="RAID0 striped" size=9 601 967 652 864 
             free=9 597 901 369 344 raid-type=0 raid-device-count=5 raid-max-component-size=none raid-master=none raid-state="clean" nvme-tcp-export=no 
             iscsi-export=no nfs-sharing=no smb-sharing=no media-sharing=no media-interface=none 
```

Based on this configuration you can modify the RAID 10 configuration to fit as many storage devices as you require.

Similarly it is possible to create other nested RAID configurations, keeping the same principle as showcased in the example.
