# RouterOS configuration reset

## How to Reset Configuration

To reset RouterOS to its factory defaults (including removing the current password), follow these steps:

1. Disconnect the device from power.
2. Press and hold the reset button.

![Reset button](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management/img/reset-button_01.png)

1. While holding the button, reconnect power to the device.
2. Watch the LEDs. One of the LEDs (typically the USR/User LED) will begin flashing.
3. Release the reset button when the LED starts flashing.

The device will reboot with the default configuration.

## Reset From RouterOS

If you still have access to the device, you can restore the default configuration directly from RouterOS:

- Run the following command in the terminal: **`/system/reset-configuration`**

- Or navigate to **System → Reset Configuration** in **[WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox)** or **[WebFig](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/webfig)**.

## Using the Reset Button

MikroTik devices include a reset button that can perform several functions depending on how long it is held during startup.

### Load the Backup RouterBOOT Loader

Press and hold the reset button before applying power, then release it after approximately 3 seconds. This loads the backup RouterBOOT loader.

This can be useful if the device is unable to boot because of a failed RouterBOOT upgrade. Once booted with the backup loader, you can either force the backup loader in RouterBOARD settings or reinstall RouterBOOT from an `.fwf` file.

### Reset the RouterOS Configuration

Press and hold the reset button until the LED starts flashing, then release it. The device will reset its RouterOS configuration to the factory defaults.

### Enable CAPs Mode

Continue holding the button for approximately **5 additional seconds** after the LED begins flashing. When the LED becomes solid, release the button to enable **[CAPs mode](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wireless/abgn/capsman)**.

**CAPs mode** can also be enabled from the command line: `/system/reset-configuration caps-mode=yes`

### Start Netinstall Mode

Press and hold the reset button while powering on the device. Continue holding the button until the LED sequence completes (typically blinking → solid → off), then release it.

The device will enter Netinstall mode and start searching for a Netinstall server on the network.

For detailed Netinstall instructions, see the **[Netinstall documentation](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall)**.

## Reset Jumper Method

Older RouterBOARD models are also fitted with a reset jumper hole. Some devices might need an opening of the enclosure. RB750/RB951/RB751 have the jumper hole under one of the rubber feet of the enclosure.

Short the reset jumper using a metal screwdriver and boot the board until the configuration is cleared:

### Jumper reset for older models

The image below shows the location of the Reset Jumper on older RouterBOARDs like RB133C:

:::danger
Don't forget to remove the jumper after the configuration has been reset, or it will be reset every time you reboot!

### WPS

Some devices have a WPS button, or a reset button with WPS functionality that can be used to simplify wireless client connections without manually entering a password. Some models also support WPS synchronization between devices.
For model-specific information about WPS and reset button functionality, refer to the [User Manual](https://manual.mikrotik.com/hardware) for your device.
