# x86 Licensing

## Licensing Basics

For x86 systems (PC-based installations), a license key must be obtained. Each system has a unique identifier called the **Software ID**, which is used for licensing purposes.

The license key is provided as a block of characters. It can be copied from your MikroTik account or from the email you received after purchase, and then pasted into the router. You can paste the key directly into the terminal or use the **Paste Key** option in the WinBox License menu. A reboot is required for the license to take effect.

:::info
**x86 Software ID** is bound to the storage device (for example, NAND, SSD, HDD, NVMe) MBR.
:::

Before purchasing a license, verify that the Software ID remains unchanged after a reboot.

:::danger
The Software ID may change if the underlying storage or configuration is unstable. This can occur, for example, when:

- using defective or failing storage devices (SSD, HDD, NVMe).
- RAID configurations are set up incorrectly or are not persistent.
- different storage controllers or adapters are used between boots.

:::

### System Requirements

- **Package version:** RouterOS v6.34 or newer.
- **Host CPU:** x86-64 architecture (64-bit).
- **RAM:** 512 MB or more.
- **Disk:** 128 MB or more.
- **RouterOS v6:** Maximum supported hard drive size is 16 GB.
- **RouterOS v7:** Maximum RAM and disk space are limited by Linux kernel 5.6.3 and depend on the specific hardware.

The minimum required RAM depends on the interface count and CPU count. Use the following formulas to calculate an approximate value:

- **RouterOS v6:** `RAM = 128 + [ 8 × (CPU_COUNT) × (INTERFACE_COUNT - 1) ]`
- **RouterOS v7:** `RAM = 512 + [ 8 × (CPU_COUNT) × (INTERFACE_COUNT - 1) ]`

## RouterOS License Key Levels

Licensing information can be retrieved from the [`/system/license`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/cli-reference/system/license) menu:

```text
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/license/print
    software-id: "ABCD-1234"
         nlevel: 6
       features:
[admin@MikroTik] >
```

It can also be viewed from the equivalent [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/management-tools/winbox) or [WebFig](https://manual.mikrotik.com/management-tools/webfig) menu.

After installation of the x86 system, RouterOS runs in **Trial mode** with no limitations. You have 24 hours to register for a **Level 1 (Free Demo)** license, or purchase a Level 4, 5, or 6 license and apply a valid key.

```text
[admin@MikroTik] /system/license/print 
  software-id: TRPC-YYR2
   expires-in: 23h48m24s
```

The differences between license levels are shown in the table below:

<WideTable>

| **Level Number** | **0 (Trial Mode)** | **1 (Free Demo)** | **4 (WISP)** | **5 (WISP)** | **6 (Controller)** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Price** | [no key](https://www.mikrotik.com/download.html) | [Free (Registration Required)](https://mikrotik.com/client/) | $45 | $95 | $250 |
| **Wireless4 AP mode (PtMP)** | 24h trial | - | yes | yes | yes |
| **Wireless6 AP mode** | - | - | yes | yes | yes |
| **PPPoE tunnels** | 24h trial | 1 | 200 | 500 | unlimited |
| **PPTP tunnels** | 24h trial | 1 | 200 | 500 | unlimited |
| **L2TP tunnels** | 24h trial | 1 | 200 | 500 | unlimited |
| **OVPN tunnels** | 24h trial | 1 | 200 | unlimited | unlimited |
| **HotSpot active users** | 24h trial | 1 | 200 | 500 | unlimited |
| **User Manager active sessions** | 24h trial | 1 | 20 | 50 | unlimited |

</WideTable>

:::info
If a feature is not listed, it is not restricted by the license.
:::

:::warning
The demo license limits the router to a single interface. This restriction applies to multiple interface types (veth, vlan, vxlan, etc.), not only those listed in the table.
:::

:::note
Level 2 was a transitional license from the legacy (pre-2.8) license format. These licenses are no longer available. Existing Level 2 licenses continue to function, but upgrading requires the purchase of a new license. Level 3 licenses are intended for wireless station (client/CPE) use only. *For x86 PCs, Level 3 is not available for individual purchase.*
:::

### All Licenses

- Never expire — a running, licensed router can be used indefinitely.
- Support an unlimited number of interfaces.
- Are valid for a single installation each.
- Include unlimited software upgrades (exception: the demo license does not allow RouterOS version upgrades, starting from version 7.8).

### Prepaid Key

A Prepaid Key is a type of license that can be purchased in advance for MikroTik products. It allows you to acquire a license without immediately assigning it to a specific device. When obtained, a Prepaid Key can be used to upgrade a CHR instance or converted into a license key for an x86 system or RouterBOARD device by using the target Software ID.

:::

## Obtaining and Managing Licenses

### Where can I buy a RouterOS license key?

To purchase a license for an **x86 PC installation**, you must register an [account on our website](https://www.mikrotik.com/client) and use the [Purchase a RouterOS license key](#how-to-purchase-a-routeros-license-key) option available within the account portal.

### Can I Upgrade the x86 License Level?

To upgrade the x86 license level, you must purchase the desired license key at full price.

### If You Purchased Your Key Elsewhere

If your license was purchased through a third-party vendor, contact that vendor directly for support, as they are responsible for assisting with licenses they have sold.

### If I Have a License and Want to Move It to Another Account

When an x86 license key has been applied, it is tied to your MikroTik account and cannot be transferred to another account. The only type of license that can be transferred between accounts is an unused prepaid key. Prepaid keys received as gifts from Training are not transferable. To transfer a purchased prepaid key, navigate to **Transfer prepaid keys** under the **ROUTEROS KEYS** section in your MikroTik Account.

### If You Have Lost a License on Your Device

If you have lost the license from your router for any reason, upgrade the router to the latest available RouterOS version and use the **"Request license key"** option in your [mikrotik.com](https://mikrotik.com) account. When submitting the request, use the Software ID and serial number found under the [`/system/license`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/cli-reference/system/license) menu in RouterOS. When received, apply the license key to your device. If the request feature does not work, contact [support@mikrotik.com](mailto:support@mikrotik.com) for assistance.

:::warning
*If the license was lost due to repairs that were not performed by a distributor under warranty, you must purchase a new RouterOS license at full price.*
:::

## Using the License

### Can I Format or Re-Flash the Drive?

Formatting or re-imaging the storage device by using non-MikroTik tools (such as `dd` or `fdisk`) destroys your license.

Exercise extreme caution and contact MikroTik support before attempting this. Such actions are not recommended, and replacement license requests may be denied.

To reinstall RouterOS safely, use official MikroTik tools such as **Netinstall** or install from a disk image by creating bootable installation media (for example, USB flash drive).

### How many computers can I use the License on?

A RouterOS license can only be used on a single device/system.

On x86 systems, the license is tied to the **Software ID**, which is bound to the storage device (MBR). This allows you to move the same storage device to another computer without losing the license. However, the license cannot be transferred to a different storage device.

Formatting or overwriting the storage device permanently erases the license, requiring a new one.

:::danger
**Important:** When moving or modifying storage, perform all actions carefully. Changes such as using different storage controllers or adapters, or modifying BIOS/UEFI settings, may alter the Software ID and result in license loss.
:::

For best practices, generate and save `supout.rif` files before and after any hardware changes. If the Software ID changes, you can provide these files to MikroTik support for review.

If the Software ID has changed, you may request a replacement key.

### Can I temporarily use the storage device for something else, other than RouterOS?

No.

### Can I move the license to another storage device (for example, SSD, HDD, NVMe)?

If your current storage device is damaged or cannot be used, the license can be transferred to a new device by requesting a replacement key.

A replacement key is available for $10.

### Must I type the whole key into the router?

No, simply copy the key and paste it into the [`/system/license`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/cli-reference/system/license) menu's **Paste Key** option, then confirm the reboot.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/routeros-licensing/img/manual_x86_key_01.png)

Alternatively, paste the key directly into the CLI and press **Y** to reboot.

### Can I install another OS on my drive and then reinstall RouterOS later?

No. If you use formatting, partitioning utilities, or any other tools that modify the MBR, you lose your license and must obtain a new one. This process is not free (see [Replacement Key](#replacement-key)).

### I Lost My RouterBOARD - Can I Transfer the License to Another System?

MikroTik hardware includes an embedded license that is permanently tied to the device. This license cannot be transferred to another system under any circumstances. This restriction also applies to any license upgrades that were applied to the router while it was operational.

### Licenses Purchased from Resellers

The keys that you purchase from other vendors and resellers are not in your account. Your [mikrotik.com](https://mikrotik.com) account only contains licenses purchased from MikroTik directly.

### I am not using the software, can you terminate my license?

Licenses are stand-alone keys, and MikroTik does not have remote control over your devices. As a result, it cannot verify whether a license is actively being used. For this reason, MikroTik is unable to terminate any issued licenses.

### Can I upgrade or transfer an x86 license to a CHR license?

Upgrading or transferring an x86 or a RouterBOARD license to a CHR license or vice versa is not supported. A separate license must be purchased for CHR.

### What if I Entered the Wrong Software ID When Purchasing a Key?

If a license key was generated using an incorrect Software ID (for example, a typo such as entering `1` instead of `I`), you can correct the Software ID on the key without contacting support. This feature allows fixing up to 1-2 characters of the Software ID:

1. Log in to your [mikrotik.com](https://mikrotik.com) account.
2. Navigate to **"Search and view all keys"**.
3. Open the folder for the purchase year — **"Purchased YYYY"**, where **"YYYY"** represents the current year.
4. Select the key in question and select **"Edit"**.
5. Select **"Fix Software ID"**.
6. Correct the characters in the Software ID field and save.
