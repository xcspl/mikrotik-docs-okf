# Supout.rif

A support output file (`supout.rif`) is a diagnostic snapshot of the router for MikroTik support. It holds the router's configuration, its logs, the state of its processes, the output of monitor commands such as the status of the interfaces and, when RouterOS has crashed, the crash data. Create it while the problem is present, so that it shows the router in that state, and send it with your request through the [MikroTik support](https://mikrotik.com/support) page.

After an unexpected reboot or a crash, create the file right away, before you upgrade or reboot the router again. Also send `autosupout.rif` and `autosupout.old.rif` if they are in the file list.

The file is encoded. To view its contents, log in to your MikroTik account and use the "Supout.rif viewer" tool in the left navigation column to upload and analyze the file.

## Create the file

In the CLI, run [`/system/sup-output`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/sup-output):

```ros
/system/sup-output
```

The command writes `supout.rif` and shows its progress as `created: 42%` up to `created: 100%`. It takes from a few seconds to longer on routers with large configurations. The size depends on the router; on a home router, the file is typically about 1 MB.

To use another name, set `name`. RouterOS adds the `.rif` extension when the name has none, so `name=supout.rif` also writes `supout.rif`. A file of the same name is replaced. A path writes the file into a folder, for example on a USB disk:

```ros
/system/sup-output name=usb1/supout
```

If the router's file list has a `flash` folder, files outside it are lost on reboot. Write the file into `flash` (`name=flash/supout`) when the router can reboot before you download it. See [Files](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/files).

### Create the file at a set time

For a problem that happens at a known time, for example every evening, let the scheduler create the file:

```ros
/system/scheduler/add name=evening-supout start-time=20:00:00 \
    interval=1d on-event="/system/sup-output name=evening-supout"
```

Each run replaces the file of the previous day. After the run you need, download `evening-supout.rif` and remove the entry:

```ros
/system/scheduler/remove evening-supout
```

### WinBox

The screenshots show WinBox 3. Select **Make Supout.rif** in the main menu, then select **Start** in the window that opens. The window shows the file name and the progress in **Created**.

When the file is ready, it is listed in **Files**. Right-click it and select **Download**, or drag the file to your desktop. In WinBox 4, download it from **Files** (see [Manage files in WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/files#manage-files-in-winbox)).

### WebFig

The screenshot shows an older WebFig. Select **Make Supout.rif** in the menu. Then open **Files** and select **Download** next to `supout.rif`.

## Download the file

Download the file with **Files** in WinBox or WebFig (see [Manage files in WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/files#manage-files-in-winbox)), or with `scp` or SFTP from your computer. These need the SSH service of the router enabled and allowed from your computer (see [Services](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/services)):

```bash
scp admin@192.168.88.1:supout.rif .
```

For a file in a folder, give its path:

```bash
scp admin@192.168.88.1:usb1/supout.rif .
```

FTP works too, when the FTP service of the router is enabled.

## Automatic supout after a crash

When RouterOS software fails, the router writes `autosupout.rif` by itself, and the previous file is renamed to `autosupout.old.rif`. The watchdog setting `automatic-supout` controls this, and it is on by default. With `auto-send-supout`, the router also sends the file by email; this needs the email settings of the watchdog. A watchdog reboot is not a software failure and does not write the file. See [Watchdog](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/watchdog).

## Technical details

### Output width

If the viewer shows the command outputs of the file too narrow, create the file again with a larger `output-width`:

```ros
/system/sup-output name=supout output-width=300
```

### File format

The file is text: a series of encoded sections, each between a `--BEGIN ROUTEROS SUPOUT SECTION` line and a `--END ROUTEROS SUPOUT SECTION` line. The sections cannot be read without the viewer.

For the parameters, see the [`/system/sup-output`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/sup-output) CLI reference.
