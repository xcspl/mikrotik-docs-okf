# Packages

## Summary

RouterOS features are organized into packages, which are files with a `.npk` extension. Most features are bundled in the ***routeros*** package, while some features are provided as separate packages. Installing an additional `.npk` package enables specific features such as Containers or The Dude. Package files are provided exclusively by MikroTik and cannot be created by third parties. You can download extra packages from our download page, or add them directly from your router.

## Minimum requirements

RouterOS requires only the system package to operate at a bare minimum, but for most devices standard operation and features are available when you install the "routeros" bundle package.

For wireless devices, several wireless packages are available, depending on the hardware you are using:

- Starting with RouterOS 7.13, the ***routeros*** (system) package and one of the following wireless packages are needed for the basic operation of a simple home router:
  1. 802.11ax WiFi APs require radio drivers, which are provided by the ***wifi-qcom*** package (for RouterOS versions earlier than 7.13 it was called the *wifiwave2* package).
  2. Previous generation WiFi APs require a ***wireless*** package.

More information about which wireless package to use is available in the [Wireless manual](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wireless/index.md).

Other packages are optional and not required for a home router. Install them only if you are sure of their purpose.

## Installing packages

### Manual download

To manually download and install extra packages, download the necessary package from the [MikroTik download](https://mikrotik.com/download) page, selecting the RouterOS section based on your device's architecture found in the System/Resources menu. Extract the archive and upload the required package to your router by using any convenient method, and proceed to reboot the router.

### Download directly from the router

You can download and install extra packages directly from the router by using the *System Packages* section.

1. After executing the ***Check For Updates*** command, available packages will be listed in the *Packages* list, but they will show up as disabled. The available package list comes from the MikroTik download server. Those packages are available, but not yet on your router (as indicated by the flags X (Disabled) and A (Available)).
2. To download an extra package, first select the package and select ***Enable***.
3. To make the router download the package, select ***Apply Changes*** and the device will ask for a reboot.

### Verification of install

To make sure the package is installed successfully, check the "Log" section after the device is rebooted. If the package is installed successfully, you will see a message about it. If there have been conflicts or some requirement is not met, this will be explained, so you can take further steps to rectify that.

## Auto install

You can also automatically install packages after uploading them to the router with FTP or SFTP. The package file must be named with the extension `*.auto.npk`. Once the file is uploaded, the router will automatically go into reboot to install the package. This can be useful for scripting and automation.

The `.auto.npk` extension in the filename is mandatory for a package to be automatically installed.
