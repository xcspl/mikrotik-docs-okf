# Getting Started

Getting Started covers initial RouterOS setup, configuration management, installation, licensing, upgrades, backups, and first-time security tasks. Use this section to bring a router into service and maintain the base system.

## Quickstart: connect to your router

If you just unboxed a MikroTik device and want to reach its admin interface:

1. Connect an Ethernet cable from your computer to any port **except** `ether1` on the router.
2. Plug in the power. Wait about a minute for the device to finish booting.
3. Reach the admin interface using any of:
   - A browser at **`http://192.168.88.1`** (WebFig)
   - **[WinBox](https://mikrotik.com/download)** — a desktop GUI for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - The **MikroTik mobile app** (iOS / Android)
4. Log in as user **`admin`** with the device-specific password printed on the **sticker on the router** (also on the box it came in).

You're in. When you're ready to actually configure internet access, Wi-Fi, firewall rules, and so on, follow the full [First Time Configuration](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/first-time-configuration.md) guide.
