# Default configurations

All MikroTik devices come with some kind of default configuration. There are several different configurations depending on the board type:

- CPE Router
- LTE CPE AP router
- AP Router (single or dual-band)
- PTP Bridge, W60G Bridge (AP or CPE)
- WISP Bridge (AP in ap\_bridge mode)
- Switch
- IP Only
- CAP

You can run the command `/system/default-configuration/print` to see the exact applied default configuration commands.

## CPE Router
---

In this type of configuration, the router is set up as a wireless client device. The WAN interface is a **Wireless** interface. The WAN port has a DHCP client configured, is protected by an IP firewall, and MAC discovery and connection are disabled.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- RB 711,911,912,921,922 - with level3 license
- SXT
- QRT
- SEXTANT
- LHG
- LDF
- DISC

- Metal

**CPE Router Mode**

- wireless interface is connected to the provider's network (WAN port);
- WAN port is protected by a firewall and has DHCP client enabled

## LTE CPE AP router
---

This configuration type is applied to routers that have both LTE and wireless interfaces. The LTE interface is the WAN port, protected by a firewall and with MAC discovery and connection disabled. The IP address on the WAN port is acquired automatically. The wireless interface is configured as an access point and bridged with all available Ethernet ports.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- wAP LTE Kit
- SXT LTE
- LtAP 4G kit
- LtAP LTE kit
- Chateau

**LTE CPE AP Router Mode**

- wireless interface is connected to the provider's network (WAN)

This refers to the LTE interface, not a wireless interface.

- WAN port is protected by the firewall and has DHCP client enabled

## AP Router
---

This configuration type is applied to home access point routers to be used without additional configuration (except router passwords and wireless keys).

The first Ethernet interface is configured as a WAN port (protected by a firewall, DHCP client enabled, and MAC connection and discovery disabled). Other Ethernet ports and wireless interfaces are added to the LAN bridge with IP address 192.168.88.1/24 set and a DHCP server configured. In the case of dual-band routers, one wireless interface is configured as a 5 GHz access point and the other as a 2.4 GHz access point.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- RB 450,751,850,951,953,2011,3011,4011
- hEX, PowerBox
- mAP

- cAP
- OmniTIK
- CRS series with wireless interface

**AP Router Mode**

- WAN port is protected by a firewall and has DHCP client enabled
- Wireless and Ethernet interfaces (except WAN port/s) are part of the LAN bridge

## PTP Bridge
---

Ethernet is bridged with a wireless interface. IP address 192.168.88.1/24 is set on the bridge interface. There are two options - CPE and AP. For CPE, the wireless interface uses "station-bridge" mode, and for AP, it uses "bridge" mode.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- DynaDish - as CPE

**PTP Bridge Mode**

- Wireless and LAN interfaces are bridged;

## W60G Bridge
---

This configuration type is applied to routers that have a 60 GHz point-to-point link.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- Cube, Cube Pro
- nRAY, Dish
- Wireless Wire kit
- wAP 60G - with level3 license

## WISP Bridge
---

The configuration matches PTP Bridge in AP mode, except that wireless mode is set to ap\_bridge for PTMP setups. You can access the router directly by using a MAC address. If the device is connected to a network with an enabled DHCP server, a DHCP client configured on the bridge interface gets an IP address that you can use to access the router.

List of routers using this type of configuration:

- RB 911,912,921,922 - with Level4 license.
- Groove A, RB 711 A
- BaseBox, NetBox

## CAP
---

This configuration type is used when a device needs to operate as a wireless client device controlled by [CAPsMAN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wireless/abgn/capsman/index.md).

When the CAP default configuration is loaded, ether1 is the management port with a DHCP client configured. All other Ethernet interfaces are bridged, and wlan1 is managed by CAPsMAN.

To load the CAP configuration, refer to [Reset Button manual](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management/routeros-configuration-reset.md).
