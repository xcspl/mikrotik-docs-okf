# MikroTik Hardware Licensing

## Licensing Basics

MikroTik hardware routers that run RouterOS come with a license pre-installed. If you have purchased a RouterOS-based device, no additional steps are required.

## RouterOS License Key Levels

Licensing information can be retrieved from the CLI system console:

```text
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/license/print
    software-id: "ABCD-1234"
         nlevel: 6
       features:
[admin@MikroTik] >
```

The same information can also be viewed in [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/management-tools/winbox) or [WebFig](https://manual.mikrotik.com/management-tools/webfig).

```text
[admin@MikroTik] /system/license/print 
  software-id: TRPC-YYR2
   expires-in: 23h48m24s
```

The differences between license levels are shown in the table below:

:::info
Level 2 was a transitional license from the legacy (pre-2.8) license format. These licenses are no longer available. Existing Level 2 licenses will continue to function, but upgrading requires the purchase of a new license. Level 3 licenses are intended for wireless station (client/CPE) use only.

:::info
If a feature is not listed, it is not restricted by the license.

:::info
**RouterBOARD Software ID** is bound to the device storage.

### All Licenses

- Never expire — a running, licensed router can be used indefinitely.
- Support an unlimited number of interfaces.
- Are valid for a single installation each.
- Include unlimited software upgrades.

:::warning
**wifi-qcom** drivers support PTMP operations regardless of license level. **Mode: AP** is universally available on all **wifi-qcom** devices, enabling connections from multiple client stations.
:::

## Upgrading the device license level

If you need to upgrade the device license level, you must purchase a higher-level license either as a [Prepaid key](#prepaid-key) or directly as a [RouterOS license](#how-to-purchase-a-routeros-license-key) tied to the device **Software ID**.

The license key is provided as a block of characters. It can be copied from your MikroTik account or from the email you received after purchase, and then pasted into the router. You can paste the key directly into the terminal or use the **Paste Key** option in the WinBox License menu. A reboot is required for the license to take effect.

### Prepaid Key

A Prepaid Key is a type of license that can be purchased in advance for MikroTik products. It allows you to acquire a license without immediately assigning it to a specific device. Once obtained, a Prepaid Key can be used to upgrade a CHR instance or converted into a license key for an x86 system or RouterBOARD device using the target Software ID.

## Obtaining and Managing Licenses

### Where can I buy a RouterOS license key?

All MikroTik hardware devices include a preinstalled RouterOS license.

### If You Have Lost a License on Your Device

If you have lost the license from your router for any reason, upgrade the router to the latest available RouterOS version and use the **"Request license key"** option in your [mikrotik.com](https://mikrotik.com) account. When submitting the request, use the Software ID and serial number found under the `/system/license` menu in RouterOS. Once received, apply the license key to your device. If the request feature does not work, contact [support@mikrotik.com](mailto:support@mikrotik.com) for assistance.

### My router has lost the license, can I request a Replacement Key?

No, Replacement keys are available for x86 only.

:::warning
*If the license was lost due to repairs that were not performed by a distributor under warranty, you will be required to purchase a new RouterOS license at full price.*
:::

## Using the License

### Can I transfer a MikroTik hardware license?

MikroTik hardware includes an embedded license that is permanently tied to the device. This license cannot be transferred to another system under any circumstances. This restriction also applies to any license upgrades that were applied to the router while it was operational.

### Is it possible to upgrade or transfer the router license to an x86 system or a CHR license?

Transferring the device license is not possible.
