# IP Packing

IP Packing collects the outgoing packets of an interface into larger packets (aggregation) and can also compress them. The router at the other end of the link unpacks them again. Both routers run RouterOS; packing is part of the system package. Use it on links where many small packets cost more than a few large ones.

:::warning
TCP connections that the router itself opens over a packed link fail, for example a fetch or a bandwidth test. The unpacked TCP segments that carry data arrive with an incorrect checksum and are dropped, so the connections never complete. Ping passes. Test the traffic you need on a test link before you enable packing on a production link.

## Prerequisites

- [Neighbor discovery](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/neighbor-discovery) runs on the interface on both routers: `discover-interface-list` in [`/ip/neighbor/discovery-settings`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/neighbor/discovery-settings) includes the interface. The default configuration discovers only on the `LAN` interface list, so a tunnel or a WAN interface needs a list that contains it. The `LAN` list also decides what the default firewall trusts, so use a separate list for discovery rather than adding such an interface to `LAN`. For example, a list that holds the `LAN` list and `ether1`:

  ```ros
  /interface/list/add name=discover include=LAN
  /interface/list/member/add list=discover interface=ether1
  /ip/neighbor/discovery-settings/set discover-interface-list=discover
  ```

- The two routers share a layer 2 link: a cable, a bridged wireless link or an EoIP tunnel. Packed packets travel in Ethernet frames, and neighbor discovery works on layer 2.
- Both routers are configured symmetrically: what one router packs, the other unpacks. A router packs toward a neighbor only when that neighbor announces that it unpacks.

## Configure packing

Router-A and Router-B are connected with a cable, on `ether1` of Router-A and `ether3` of Router-B. This example aggregates the packets that Router-A sends and leaves the packets from Router-B as they are.

On Router-A:

```ros
/ip/packing/add interface=ether1 packing=simple unpacking=none
```

On Router-B:

```ros
/ip/packing/add interface=ether3 packing=none unpacking=simple
```

To pack in both directions, set `packing=simple unpacking=simple` on both routers.

The default `aggregated-size` of 1500 bytes is the size that packing tries to reach before it sends a packet.

In WinBox, open **IP > Packing** and select **New**:

1. Choose the link interface in **Interface**, such as `ether1` on Router-A. The screenshot shows a new rule before the interface is selected.
2. Set **Packing**, **Unpacking**, and **Aggregated Size** to match the traffic direction and the settings on the other router. For Router-A in the example, use `simple`, `none`, and `1500`, then select **OK**.

## Check that packing works

Each router announces its unpacking setting through neighbor discovery. Run `/ip/neighbor/print detail where interface=ether1` on Router-A: the entry for Router-B shows `unpack=simple`, because Router-B unpacks. On Router-B, the entry for Router-A shows `unpack=none`. The values `none`, `simple`, `uncompress-headers` and `uncompress-all` correspond to the `unpacking` settings `none`, `simple`, `compress-headers` and `compress-all`.

When the remote router has no neighbor entry on the interface, or its entry shows `unpack=none`, the router does not pack toward it and sends the packets as they are.

In a packet capture, packed frames have the EtherType 0x9000.

## Latency

Packing holds packets back for a short time to combine them, so it adds delay. On a fast link, the ping round-trip time can rise from under a millisecond to tens of milliseconds. Take this into account for voice and other real-time traffic.

For all parameters, see the CLI reference for [`/ip/packing`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/packing) and [`/ip/neighbor/discovery-settings`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/neighbor/discovery-settings).
