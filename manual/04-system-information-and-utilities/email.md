# Email

The router sends email through an SMTP server: the server of your email provider or your own mail server. Scripts and the [scheduler](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/scheduler) use it to send alerts, backups and configuration exports, and the [watchdog](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/watchdog) uses it to send support output files.

The router logs in to the server with AUTH PLAIN. For encryption, it uses TLS from the start of the connection (`tls=yes`) or upgrades a plain connection with STARTTLS (`tls=starttls`). Without TLS, the user name and password cross the network unencrypted, so use TLS with every server that is not on your own network.

## Configure the SMTP server

The server settings are in [`/tool/e-mail`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/e-mail). Choose `tls` to match the port of the server:

| Port | `tls` | Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 587 | `starttls` | Mail submission with STARTTLS, offered by most email providers. |
| 465 | `yes` | Implicit TLS: the connection is encrypted from the start. |
| 25 | `no` | Plain SMTP, only for a relay on your own network that accepts it. |

The two do not mix: `tls=yes` on port 587 fails with `TLS handshake failed`, and `tls=starttls` on port 465 fails with `timeout occured`.

For example, to send through Gmail with STARTTLS and certificate verification:

```ros
/tool/e-mail/set server=smtp.gmail.com port=587 tls=starttls \
    certificate-verification=yes from=you@gmail.com \
    user=you@gmail.com password="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
```

:::info
Gmail does not accept your Google account password from devices such as routers. Turn on 2-Step Verification for your Google account, create an App password (in your Google account under **Security**, **App passwords**), and use the generated 16-character password as `password`.
:::

`certificate-verification` is `no` by default: the router encrypts the connection, but does not check the server's certificate. Set it to `yes` to check the certificate against the router's trust store. The built-in trust store covers email by default, so the certificate of a public provider such as Gmail verifies without further setup. When the certificate does not match the server name, the send fails with `TLS handshake failed (ssl: name verification failed for: ...)`.

In WinBox, open **Tools > Email** to configure the SMTP connection:

1. Set **Server**, **Port**, and **TLS** to the values supplied by your email provider. The screenshot shows unconfigured values, not settings for a working mail server.
2. Enter the sender address in **From**. Use the **+** controls to set **User** and **Password** if the server requires authentication.
3. Review **Certificate Verification** for a TLS connection and select **OK** to save the configuration. Use the server settings in the CLI reference for the verification options and certificate requirements.

## Send a message

Send a message with [`/tool/e-mail/send`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/e-mail/send):

```ros
/tool/e-mail/send to=admin@example.com subject="Router alert" \
    body="The backup link is down."
```

The command uses the settings of `/tool/e-mail`. Any setting given to the command, such as `server`, `port`, `tls` or `from`, overrides the setting for this message only.

- Separate several recipients with commas, in `to` and in `cc`. The router sends one message to all of them.
- `\n` in `body` starts a new line.
- `file` attaches files from the router's file list, several separated by commas. A file that does not exist is refused before the message is sent, with `input does not match any value of file`.
- Always set `from`. Without it, the router sends the message with an empty sender (`<>`), which many servers refuse.

`/tool/e-mail/print` shows the result of the last message in `last-status`: `succeeded` or `failed`.

To send a message in WinBox, open **Tools > Email** and select **Send Email** in the right panel:

1. Set **To** and **Subject**. Use **Cc** for additional recipients and **From** to override the configured sender when required.
2. Enter the message in **Body**. Use the **+** control beside **Files** to attach a file already stored on the router.

![WinBox Send Email dialog with recipient, subject, body, and attachments](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/img/email-send-winbox.webp)

Review the SMTP settings and recipients, then select **Send Email** to transmit the message. **Cancel** closes the dialog without sending it. Check **Last Status** in Email Settings if delivery fails.

## Email the configuration export every day

Send the router's configuration export to an administrator every night.

1. Configure the SMTP server, for example a relay on your network:

   ```ros
   /tool/e-mail/set server=192.0.2.25 port=25 from=router@example.com
   ```

2. Add a [script](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/scripting/) named `export-email` that writes the export and sends it:

   ```ros
   /export file=export
   /tool/e-mail/send to=config@example.com file=export.rsc \
       subject="$[/system/identity/get name] export" \
       body="$[/system/clock/get date] configuration file"
   ```

3. Add a [scheduler](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/scheduler) entry that runs the script every 24 hours:

   ```ros
   /system/scheduler/add name=export-email on-event=export-email \
       start-time=00:00:00 interval=24h
   ```

The export hides passwords and other sensitive values by default, see [Configuration export](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management/#configuration-export).

## Troubleshoot

When a message cannot be sent, the command stops with a `failure:` message and `last-status` is `failed`:

| Message | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `TLS handshake failed (timeout)` | `tls=yes` against a STARTTLS port such as 587. Use `tls=starttls`. |
| `TLS not supported by server` | `tls=starttls`, but the server does not offer STARTTLS. The router does not fall back to an unencrypted connection. |
| `timeout occured` | No answer from the server, for example `tls=no` or `tls=starttls` against an implicit TLS port such as 465. |
| `invalid FROM address` | The server refused the sender. Gmail also answers this way to a connection without TLS, so check `tls` as well as `from`. |
| `AUTH failed` | Wrong `user` or `password`. Gmail needs an App password. |
| `recipient address required` | `to` is missing. |
| `TLS handshake failed (ssl: name verification failed for: ...)` | With `certificate-verification=yes`, the server's certificate does not match the server name. |

When `server` is a name, `last-address` in `/tool/e-mail/print` shows the address the router connected to.

## Technical details

### SMTP session

The router greets the server with its address in brackets (for example `EHLO [192.0.2.1]`) and logs in with AUTH PLAIN. Each message has a `Date` header in the router's time zone and a `Message-ID` that ends with the router identity.

### Text and attachments

A message without attachments has no MIME headers: the router sends the subject and body as they are, without declaring a character set. With attachments, the message is `multipart/mixed`, the text part is declared as US-ASCII, and each file is attached as `application/octet-stream` with its file name. Gmail shows UTF-8 text in both cases correctly. For alerts that must read correctly in every mail client, use plain ASCII text.

### VRF

`vrf` in `/tool/e-mail` selects the VRF in which the router opens the connection to the server.

For all parameters, see the CLI reference for [`/tool/e-mail`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/e-mail) and [`/tool/e-mail/send`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/e-mail/send).
