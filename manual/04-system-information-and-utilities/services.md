# Services

The `/ip/service` menu lists the services the router offers for management and access: WinBox, SSH, Telnet, FTP, the web server, the API and the reverse proxy. Each service has a port, the addresses and the VRF it accepts clients from, and, for the TLS services, a certificate. You cannot add services, only change, disable and enable the existing ones.

The same menu also shows dynamic entries: the ports that other features and containers listen on, and the connections that are open to the router's services. Use the list to see which ports are open on the router and what the firewall has to allow or block.

For advice on which services to disable, how to change the SSH port and how to protect management access with the firewall, see [Securing your router](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/securing-your-router#management-service-ports).

| Service | Default port | Used for |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `ftp` | 21 | FTP file transfer to and from the router's storage |
| `ssh` | 22 | SSH access |
| `telnet` | 23 | Telnet access |
| `www` | 80 | The web server over HTTP: WebFig, the REST API and graphs |
| `www-ssl` | 443 | The web server over HTTPS; needs a certificate, see [Enable HTTPS](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/webfig#enable-https) |
| `winbox` | 8291 | [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox), the MikroTik mobile app and The Dude |
| `api` | 8728 | The [API](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/api/) |
| `api-ssl` | 8729 | The API over TLS |
| `reverse-proxy` | 443 | The [reverse proxy](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/proxy/reverse-proxy); listens only while at least one enabled rule exists |

## See what the router listens on

Dynamic entries show the ports that RouterOS features and containers listen on, and the open connections to the router's services:

```ros
/ip/service/print where dynamic
```

```text
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; c - CONNECTION
Columns: NAME, PORT, PROTO, LOCAL, REMOTE
#    NAME       PORT  PROTO  LOCAL          REMOTE
3 Dc ssh          22  tcp    192.168.88.1   192.168.88.10:53163
4 D  resolver     53  tcp
5 D  resolver     53  udp
0 D  btest      2000  tcp
1 D  discover   5678  udp
2 D  cloud     54103  udp
```

- Entries with only the `D` flag are ports a feature listens on. `NAME` is the feature or program, for example `resolver` for the DNS server, `btest` for the [bandwidth test](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/bandwidth-test) server, `discover` for [neighbor discovery](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/neighbor-discovery) and `cloud` for the local port the [MikroTik cloud](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/cloud/communication-mikrotik-cloud-servers) services use to talk to the cloud servers.
- Entries with the `c` flag are open connections to a service. `LOCAL` is the router's address and `REMOTE` is the client's address and port.
- Ports that containers listen on also show the `NETNS` and `CONTAINER` columns: the network namespace and the name of the container.

An entry appears when a feature starts to listen. For example, the `resolver` entries on port 53 appear when you set `allow-remote-requests=yes` in [`/ip/dns`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/dns). The router accepts connections on the ports of the dynamic entries and of the enabled services (the entries without the `X` flag in `/ip/service/print`). IP protocols without ports, such as GRE or OSPF, are not in the list; the tables at the end of this page list them. The ports where a feature waits for clients, such as `resolver` or `btest`, are the ones the firewall input chain has to allow for the clients that need them and block for everyone else; the default firewall already drops connections to them from the internet. You cannot change dynamic entries in `/ip/service`; change or disable the feature in its own menu instead.

## Limit who can use a service

To accept WinBox and SSH connections only from the LAN and from VPN clients:

```ros
/ip/service/set winbox,ssh available-from=192.168.88.0/24,10.8.0.0/24
/ip/service/print proplist=name,port,available-from where !dynamic
```

```text
Flags: X - DISABLED, I - INVALID
Columns: NAME, PORT, AVAILABLE-FROM
 #   NAME           PORT  AVAILABLE-FROM
 6   ftp              21
 7   ssh              22  192.168.88.0/24
                          10.8.0.0/24
 8   telnet           23
 9   www              80
10 X www-ssl         443
11   reverse-proxy   443
12   winbox         8291  192.168.88.0/24
                          10.8.0.0/24
13   api            8728
14   api-ssl        8729
```

`available-from` takes a list of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes, for example `10.5.101.0/24,2001:db8:fade::/64`. An empty list means any address. A list with only IPv4 prefixes refuses all IPv6 clients; add the IPv6 prefixes that need access.

:::warning
Include the address you manage the router from. After the change, the router refuses new connections from other addresses, including your own next login if it comes from outside the list.
:::

A client from another address can still open the TCP connection, and the router then closes it without serving the client, so a port scan still finds the port open. `available-from` suits restricting access within trusted networks. To block access from the internet and other untrusted networks, drop the traffic in the firewall input chain, as described in [Securing your router](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/securing-your-router#securing-access-to-the-device).

## Run management services in a VRF

A management VRF keeps management access apart from the networks the router serves. To make WinBox and SSH available only through a dedicated management port, `ether5`, which has the management address (for example 10.99.0.1/24):

```ros
/ip/vrf/add name=mgmt interfaces=ether5
/ip/service/set winbox,ssh vrf=mgmt
```

A service listens only in its VRF. After this change, the router refuses WinBox and SSH connections to its addresses in the main routing table and serves them only through `ether5`. For more about VRFs, see [VRF](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/vrf).

:::warning
After the change, WinBox and SSH are reachable only through the interfaces of the VRF. A session that comes in through another interface, or through `ether5` before it joins the VRF, is cut. Run both commands together, connect again through `ether5`, and keep another way in, such as MAC WinBox.
:::

## Manage services in WinBox

Open **IP > Services**. The list can also show dynamic listeners and active connections; open the configurable service row, such as `winbox`, rather than a dynamic connection entry. Use **Find** to locate the service by name.

1. Check **Port** in the service dialog. Changing it changes the port clients must use to connect.
2. Use the **+** control beside **Available From** to enter the client addresses or subnets that should have access, then select **OK**. Include the address of your management computer before restricting the service you are connected through. An empty list does not restrict client addresses.

![WinBox IP Service dialog for the winbox service](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/img/services-winbox.webp)

To turn an unused service off without changing its port, select its row in the Services list and select **Disable**. Select **Enable** to turn it on again.

## Web server

The web server has separate settings for its parts: the home page, WebFig, graphs, the REST API, and the CRL, SCEP and ACME endpoints. The `-plain` settings control HTTP connections (the `www` service), and the `-secure` settings control HTTPS connections (the `www-ssl` service). All parts are enabled by default. For the settings, see the [`/ip/service/webserver` CLI reference](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/service/webserver).

## Protocols and ports

The following tables list the ports and IP protocols that RouterOS uses. Most ports are ones the router listens on when the feature is enabled. Some are client ports: the DHCP client receives replies on UDP port 68, and the DHCPv6 client on UDP port 546. The FTP server does not listen on TCP port 20: in active mode, its data connections come from that port. For [OpenFlow](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/openflow), the router connects to the controller at the address and port set in `controllers` in `/openflow`, for example TCP port 6653, and does not listen on a port.

:::note
MAC Telnet, MAC WinBox and MAC ping work on layer 2: the packets are addressed to the router's MAC address and carry the IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255. The IP firewall does not stop them: the MAC server answers even when a filter rule drops UDP port 20561. To limit MAC access, set `allowed-interface-list` in [`/tool/mac-server`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/mac-server).
