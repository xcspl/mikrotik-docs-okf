# NTP

RouterOS includes a Network Time Protocol (NTP, [RFC 5905](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5905.html)) client and server in the main RouterOS package. The client synchronizes the router's clock with NTP servers, and the server distributes the router's time to other devices on the network. Both are disabled by default. NTP exchanges Universal Coordinated Time (UTC); the time zone and daylight saving rules for the displayed time are configured in [`/system/clock`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/clock).

## Synchronize the router's clock

Enable the client and set one or more servers:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/client/set enabled=yes servers=192.168.88.1
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/client/print
         enabled: yes
            mode: unicast
         servers: 192.168.88.1
             vrf: main
      freq-drift: 0 PPM
          status: synchronized
   synced-server: 192.168.88.1
   synced-stratum: 3
   system-offset: 13.937 ms
```

To configure the client in WinBox, open **System > NTP Client**:

1. Select **Enabled** and leave **Mode** at `unicast` for servers you query directly.
2. Enter the server address in **NTP Servers**, for example `192.168.88.1` if that device provides NTP. Use the **+** control to add more servers, then select **Apply**.
3. Check **Status**. When it reads `synchronized`, **Synced Server**, **Synced Stratum**, and **System Offset** show the selected source and its timing information. Select **OK** to close the dialog.

![WinBox NTP Client dialog synchronized to 192.168.88.1](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/img/ntp-client-winbox.webp)

The `status` field shows the client state: `stopped` while the client is disabled, `waiting` while no server is usable, and `synchronized` when the clock follows `synced-server`. With several servers the client polls them all and picks the best one.

Servers can be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or domain names (which are resolved with [`/ip/dns`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/dns); the result appears as `resolved-address`). Servers are managed in the [`/system/ntp/client/servers`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/client/servers) list. When the DHCP client has `use-peer-ntp=yes` (the default), servers received over DHCP appear in the list as dynamic entries, which cannot be edited:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/client/servers/print
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
0   address=192.168.88.1 min-poll=6 max-poll=10 iburst=yes auth-key=none

1 D address=217.198.224.12 min-poll=6 max-poll=10 iburst=yes auth-key=none

2 D address=195.244.128.12 min-poll=6 max-poll=10 iburst=yes auth-key=none
```

The client queries a server in intervals between `min-poll` and `max-poll`, counted as powers of 2 in seconds (default between 64 s and 1024 s). Right after a server is added, the client sends a rapid burst of queries once a second (iburst) to get an initial estimate quickly.

The client works in unicast mode by default, querying each server directly. The `broadcast`, `multicast` and `manycast` modes instead get the time from servers that announce it on the local network. In manycast mode the client discovers servers by itself with multicast queries.

## Serve time to other devices

Enable the server to answer time queries from the network:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/server/set enabled=yes
```

In WinBox, open **System > NTP Server**:

1. Select **Enabled** and select **OK** to allow clients to query the router's time. Configure the NTP client separately so the router has a synchronized source.
2. Review **Use Local Clock** and **Local Clock Stratum** before enabling a fallback to the router's unsynchronized clock. Leave **Use Local Clock** cleared when you require an external time source.

![WinBox NTP Server dialog with local clock fallback settings](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/img/ntp-server-winbox.webp)

The server then distributes the router's own synchronized time. With `broadcast=yes`, the time is additionally sent to the addresses in `broadcast-addresses`; `multicast=yes` distributes it over multicast; `manycast=yes` takes part in manycast discovery.

:::warning
With `use-local-clock=yes`, the router's unsynchronized clock is used as the time reference (at `local-clock-stratum`, 5 by default) when no NTP source is available. The router's clock drifts without external synchronization because its frequency varies with power management, temperature and hardware differences, so do not serve the local clock for precise timekeeping. Prefer a network time source.
:::

When the local clock is the only reference, a client in this state shows `status: using-local-clock` and `synced-server: 127.127.1.0`.

## Authenticate clients and servers

Symmetric keys configured in [`/system/ntp/key`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/key) authenticate the time exchange. Create a key and select it on the client's server entry with `auth-key`:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/key/add key-id=10 key-val=mysecret
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/client/servers/set 0 auth-key=10
```

The key value is sensitive: `print` and `export` never show it. A reply that fails authentication is rejected, the log shows `peer rejected auth (crypto NAK)`, and the client stays in the `waiting` state.

## Monitor synchronization

`/system/ntp/monitor-peers` shows the client's view of its time sources and refreshes continuously:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/ntp/monitor-peers
 type="ucast-client" address=192.168.88.1 refid="195.244.128.12" stratum=3
 hpoll=6 ppoll=6 root-delay=15.96 ms root-disp=65.368 ms offset=13.937 ms
 delay=0.566 ms disp=0.123 ms jitter=0.02 ms
```

`refid` is the source the peer itself synchronizes to. A `stratum` of 16 means the peer is not synchronized.

The estimated frequency correction of the router's clock is shown as `freq-drift` in the client settings; reset it with [`/system/ntp/client/reset-freq-drift`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/client/reset-freq-drift).

## Technical details

### NTP logging

Add a logging rule for the `ntp` topic to see the client's decisions and packet exchanges:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/logging/add topics=ntp
```

Typical messages during startup and synchronization:

```text
ntp,debug tx dst:192.168.88.1
ntp,debug rx src:192.168.88.1 dst:192.168.88.24
ntp,debug Message offset:0.027406 delay:0.000597 disp:0.000002
ntp,debug Resolved address: time.cloudflare.com -> 162.159.200.1
ntp,debug Checking peer (195.244.128.12). Peer is: NOT FIT, because p->leap == NOSYNC
ntp,debug No survivors for clock sync
ntp,debug System peer changed to: 195.244.128.12
ntp,debug peer rejected auth (crypto NAK)
```

A peer `NOT FIT, because p->leap == NOSYNC` is answering but is not synchronized itself. `rootDist` rejections indicate the source is too far from the root clock.

### Client and server scopes

The client and the server are configured independently; enabling one does not require the other. Both have a `vrf` setting (`main` by default) that scopes which routing table the NTP traffic uses.

For all properties, see [`/system/ntp/client`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/client/), [`/system/ntp/client/servers`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/client/servers), [`/system/ntp/server`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/server), [`/system/ntp/key`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/key) and [`/system/ntp/monitor-peers`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/monitor-peers) in the CLI reference.
