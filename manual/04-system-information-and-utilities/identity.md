# Identity

The system identity is the name of the router. The default is `MikroTik`. Give each router its own name so that you can tell them apart. The identity appears in several places, including:

- In the command-line prompt, for example `[admin@Riga-Office-GW] >`, and in the title of the WinBox connection.
- In [neighbor discovery](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/neighbor-discovery): neighboring devices list the router under its identity, updated with the next announcement, every 30 seconds by default.
- As the SNMP system name (`sysName`).
- As the host name that the [DHCP client](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/dhcp/client) sends to the DHCP server by default.
- As the default SSID of interfaces of the older `wireless` package ([legacy wireless](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wireless/abgn/wireless-interface)).
- In scripts, as `[/system/identity/get name]`.

The identity can be up to 64 characters long. A longer name is refused with `could not change identity: too long`. Spaces and other characters are allowed, with quotes, for example `name="Riga Office GW"`; because the DHCP host name and DNS names do not allow spaces, a name of letters, digits and hyphens works everywhere.

## Set the identity

A name that says where the router is and what it does helps when you manage several routers, for example `Riga-Office-GW`:

```ros
/system/identity/set name=Riga-Office-GW
/system/identity/print
```

```text
  name: Riga-Office-GW
```

The prompt shows the new name:

```text
[admin@Riga-Office-GW] >
```

## Set the identity in WinBox

In WinBox, open **System > Identity**, enter the router name in **Identity** (callout 1), and select **OK**. Use a name that helps you distinguish the router from other devices, such as `Home-Router`. The name also appears in WinBox's connection title.

## Set the identity over SNMP

A management system can set the identity with an SNMP set request for `sysName.0` (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0`). This needs an [SNMP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/snmp) community with write access; the default community `public` can only read and refuses an SNMPv1 set request with `readOnly`. A community with write access can also change other settings and reboot the router, so give it a name that is hard to guess, because the name works as a password, and limit it to the address of the management system:

```ros
/snmp/community/add name=netadmin-7Qx2 addresses=192.168.88.10/32 \
    write-access=yes
/snmp/set enabled=yes
```

From the management system, for example with `snmpset` on Linux or macOS:

```bash
snmpset -v 1 -c netadmin-7Qx2 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s Branch-GW
```

```text
SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: Branch-GW
```

SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c send the community name in clear text. Allow write access only from trusted addresses, or use SNMPv3 with authentication and encryption. The `public` community stays readable from any address unless you limit its addresses too.

For the parameter, see the [`/system/identity` CLI reference](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/identity).
