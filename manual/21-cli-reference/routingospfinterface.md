<ArgTableRow arg="type" typ="enum (broadcast | nbma | ptp | ptp-unnumbered | ptmp | ptmp-broadcast | virtual-link)">
The OSPF network type on this interface. Note that if interface configuration does not exist, the default network type is 'ptp' on PtP interfaces and 'broadcast' on all other interfaces.
- `broadcast` - Network type suitable for Ethernet and other multicast capable link layers. Elects designated router.
- `nbma` - Non-Broadcast Multiple Access. Protocol packets are sent to each neighbor's unicast address. Requires manual configuration of neighbors. Elects designated router.
- `ptp` - Suitable for networks that consist only of two nodes. Does not elect a designated router.
- `ptmp` - Point-to-Multipoint. Easier to configure than NBMA because it requires no manual configuration of a neighbor. Does not elect a designated router. This is the most robust network type and as such suitable for wireless networks, if 'broadcast' mode does not work well enough for them
- `ptp-unnumbered` - Works the same as ptp, except that the remote neighbor does not have an associated IP address to a specific PTP interface. For example, in case IP unnumbered is used on Cisco devices.
- `virtual-link` - Interface for virtual link.
