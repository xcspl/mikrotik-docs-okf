Counters of the cached objects the proxy revalidated with the server before it answered the client. To revalidate an object, the proxy sends a conditional request with `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match`. Each counter counts one reason. For an overview of caching, see [Web Proxy](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/proxy/web-proxy).
