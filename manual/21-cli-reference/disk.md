</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="slot" typ="string">Name of the disk item, normally based on where the device is physically connected, for example `nvme1` or `usb1`. The name is assigned automatically and can be set manually. Other commands and `parent` refer to the disk by this name.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="parent" typ="enum ()">Parent device of the item. On a `type=partition` item it selects the hardware disk the partition is created on, for example `add type=partition parent=nvme9 ...`; on `type=crypted` it is the drive or partition that is encrypted.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="mount-point-template" typ="string">
Template of the mount point, the folder under which the file system appears in `/file`. The following variables are replaced:

- `[fw-version]` - the device firmware version.
- `[fs-label]` - the file system label.
- `[fs-uuid]` - the file system UUID.
- `[fs]` - the file system type.
Variables can be combined, for example `[model]-[fs]`. An empty template is rejected, and `unset mount-point-template` restores the default `[slot]`. The default for newly added disks is set by `default-mount-point-template` in [`settings`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/settings).

RAID level of the array:
- `0` - striping: data is spread evenly over all disks, no fault tolerance, best performance.
- `1` - mirroring: the same data is written to all disks, best fault tolerance.
- `4` - block-level striping with parity stored on a dedicated disk.
- `5` - block-level striping with distributed parity, survives one disk failure.
- `6` - block-level striping with double parity, survives two disk failures.
