Transmission (Tx) Manager controls packet enqueuing for transmission and packet tx order. Different switch ports can be assigned to different Tx managers. The maximum number of hardware Tx managers depends on the switch chip model.

:::info
Port status has no effect on the allocated resources. Running ports receive the same amount of queue buffers as disconnected or disabled ones if all of them are assigned to the same Tx Manager.

For example, if queue-buffers=30%, and there are 3 ports using this Tx Manager, each respective port receives 10% of the total available resources. Adding two more ports to the Tx Manager drops per-port buffers down to 6% (30/5).</ArgTableRow>
