## cmr/device 
**Package:** cmr
**Type:** Directory

Devices managed by this CMR server. A device appears in the list as soon as it connects to the server, with the **P** flag until the pairing is approved. The server itself is shown as the device with the **L** flag. Use the commands in this menu to operate on the fleet, for example `run-script`, `upgrade`, `reboot`, or `pair`. See [CMR](https://manual.mikrotik.com/management-tools/cmr) for how devices connect and pair.
