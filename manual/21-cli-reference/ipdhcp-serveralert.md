## ip/dhcp-server/alert 
**Type:** Directory

Detects unknown (rogue) DHCP servers on an interface. The alert sends its own DHCPDISCOVER about once a minute, and checks the source of every DHCP reply it sees against `valid-server`. An unknown server is logged with the `dhcp,critical` topics, listed in `unknown-server`, and triggers `on-alert`. Because the alert sends DHCP requests itself, do not use it on an interface where the router runs a DHCP client. For details, see [DHCP Server](https://manual.mikrotik.com/network-management/dhcp/server).
