**Type:** Directory

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="chain" typ="enum" mandatory="1">Specifies to which chain the rule will be added. If the input does not match the name of an already defined chain, a new chain will be created.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="action" typ="enum (accept | jump | return | log | passthrough | add-src-to-address-list | add-dst-to-address-list | drop | reject | fasttrack-connection) { accept:0, jump:1, return:2, log:3, passthrough:4, add-src-to-address-list:5, add-dst-to-address-list:6, drop:10, reject:11, fasttrack-connection:45 }">Action to take if a packet is matched by the rule: `accept` - accept the packet. A packet is not passed to the next firewall rule.  `add-dst-to-address-list` - add the destination address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.  `add-src-to-address-list` - add the source address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.  `drop` - drop the packet.  `fasttrack-connection` - fasttrack the connection.  `jump` - jump to the user-defined chain specified by the value of the `jump-target` parameter.  `log` - add a message to the system log containing the following data: in-interface, out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port->dst-ip:port, and length of the packet. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.  `passthrough` - if a packet is matched by the rule, increase the counter and go to the next rule (useful for statistics).  `reject` - reject the packet and send an ICMP response.  `return` - passes control back to the chain from where the jump took place.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="jump-target" typ="enum ()">Name of the target chain to jump to. Applicable only if `action=jump`.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="reject-with" typ="enum (icmp-no-route | icmp-admin-prohibited | icmp-not-neighbour | icmp-address-unreachable | icmp-port-unreachable | tcp-reset | icmp-err-src-routing-header | icmp-headers-too-long) { icmp-no-route:0, icmp-admin-prohibited:1, icmp-not-neighbour:2, icmp-address-unreachable:3, icmp-port-unreachable:4, tcp-reset:6, icmp-err-src-routing-header:7, icmp-headers-too-long:8 }">
Specifies the [ICMP error](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/icmpv6-parameters.xhtml#icmpv6-parameters-codes-2) to be sent back if the packet is rejected. Applicable if `action=reject`.

- `icmp-no-route` - sends an ICMP address no-route message. ICMP type 1, code 0
- `icmp-admin-prohibited` - sends an ICMP address prohibited message. ICMP type 1, code 1
- `icmp-not-neighbour` - sends an ICMP address not-member message. ICMP type 1, code 2
- `icmp-address-unreachable` - sends an ICMP address unreachable message. ICMP type 1, code 3
- `icmp-port-unreachable` - sends an ICMP port unreachable message. ICMP type 1, code 4
- `tcp-reset` - sends an ICMP message resetting a TCP connection. ICMP type 1, code 6
- `icmp-err-src-routing-header` - sends an ICMP Error in Source Routing Header message. ICMP type 1, code 7
- `icmp-headers-too-long` - sends an ICMP Headers too long message. ICMP type 1, code 8
</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="connection-nat-state" typ="super { !
, state: ubit (srcnat, dstnat)
 }">Matches connections that are source-natted, destination-natted, or both.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="tls-host" typ="super { !
, tls-host: string
 }">Matches HTTPS traffic based on TLS SNI hostname. Accepts GLOB syntax for wildcard matching. The matcher will not be able to match the hostname if the TLS handshake frame is fragmented into multiple TCP segments.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="connection-state" typ="super { !
, state: ubit (invalid, established, related, new, untracked)
 }">Interprets the connection tracking analytics data for a particular packet: `established` - a packet that belongs to an existing connection.  `invalid` - a packet that does not have a determined state in connection tracking (usually severe out-of-order packets, packets with wrong sequence/ack number, or in case of resource over usage on the router). An invalid packet will not participate in NAT, and will still contain the original source IP address when routed. You should drop all `connection-state=invalid` packets in the firewall filter forward and input chains.  `new` - the packet has started a new connection or is otherwise associated with a connection that has not seen packets in both directions.  `related` - a packet that is related to, but not part of an existing connection, such as ICMP errors or a packet that begins an FTP data connection.  `untracked` - a packet that was set to bypass connection tracking in firewall RAW tables.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="connection-limit" typ="super { !
, limit: num
, [prefix-len] ,num [0 .. 128]
 }">Matches connections per address or address block after a given value is reached. You should use this together with `connection-state=new` and/or with `tcp-flags=syn` because the matcher is very resource-intensive.</ArgTableRow>

, protocol: enum (icmpv6) { icmpv6:58 }
 }">Matches the particular IP protocol specified by protocol name or number.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="src-address" typ="super { !

<ArgTableRow arg="address-list" typ="enum ()">Name of the address list to be used. Applicable if the action is `add-dst-to-address-list` or `add-src-to-address-list`.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="address-list-timeout" typ="alt { address-list-timeout: enum (none-dynamic | none-static) { none-dynamic:0, none-static:0xffffffff }
, address-list-timeout: time [ .. 21474836]
 }">
How long the address stays in `address-list` after the `add-src-to-address-list` or `add-dst-to-address-list` action adds it. With a time, the rule adds a dynamic entry (`D`) that the router removes when the time ends; each new match of the rule resets the time to its full value. The maximum is `35w3d13h13m56s`. An address that is already a static entry in the list stays static.
- `none-dynamic` (`0s`) - Add a dynamic entry without a timeout. It is not saved in the configuration and a reboot clears it.
- `none-static` - Add a static entry. It is saved in the configuration and in exports, and stays after a reboot until you remove it.
</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="src-address-type" typ="super { !
, type: ubit (unicast, local, anycast, multicast, unreachable)
 }">Matches the source address type: `unicast` - an IP address used for point-to-point transmission.  `local` - the address is assigned to one of the router's interfaces.  `anycast` - a packet sent to the nearest node in a group.  `multicast` - a packet is forwarded to a defined group of devices.  `unreachable` - the address is unreachable.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="dst-address-type" typ="super { !
, type: ubit (unicast, local, anycast, multicast, unreachable)

, type: ubit (hop, dst, route, frag, ah, esp, none, proto)
, [mode] [ :enum (exact | contains) { exact:0, contains:1 }]

Matches packets up to a limited rate (packet rate or bit rate). A rule with this matcher will match until this limit is reached. Parameters are written in the following format: `rate[/time],burst:mode`.
- `rate` - packet or bit count per time interval to match.
- `time` - specifies the time interval in which the packet or bit rate cannot be exceeded (optional, 1s will be used if not specified).
