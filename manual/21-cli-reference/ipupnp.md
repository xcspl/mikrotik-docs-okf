## ip/upnp 
**Type:** Settings Directory

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service settings. The service answers SSDP discovery on UDP port 1900 and control connections on TCP port 2828 of each [internal interface](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/interfaces). Any change in this menu restarts the service: all dynamic port mappings are removed and clients have to request them again. Configuration examples are on the [UPnP guide page](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/upnp).

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="enabled" typ="bool">Enable the UPnP service. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="allow-disable-external-interface" typ="bool">Allow UPnP clients on the internal interfaces to disable the router's external interface with the `ForceTermination` action, without any authentication. The UPnP standard requires this action to work; set to `no` so local clients cannot take the Internet connection down. Disabling the external interface this way also removes its dynamic port mappings. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="show-dummy-rule" typ="bool">Report an inactive placeholder port mapping (port 0, client 0.0.0.0, description "Dummy inactive rule for windows to work") as the first entry when a client enumerates port mappings. A workaround for client applications that misbehave when no port mappings exist. The dummy entry never appears in `/ip/firewall/nat`. Default: yes.</ArgTableRow>
