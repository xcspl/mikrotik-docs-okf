Action to take if a packet is matched by the rule:
- `accept` - accept the packet. A packet is not passed to the next firewall rule.
- `add-dst-to-address-list` - add the destination address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.
- `add-src-to-address-list` - add the source address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.
- `jump` - jump to the user-defined chain specified by the value of the `jump-target` parameter.
- `log` - add a message to the system log containing the following data: in-interface, out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port-&gt;dst-ip:port, and length of the packet. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.
- `passthrough` - if a packet is matched by the rule, increase the counter and go to the next rule (useful for statistics).
- `return` - passes control back to the chain from where the jump took place.
- `sniff-tzsp` - send a packet to a remote TZSP compatible system (such as Wireshark). Set remote target with `sniff-target` and `sniff-target-port` parameters (Wireshark recommends port 37008). After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.
- `sniff-pc` - send a packet to a remote RouterOS CALEA server. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.
- `drop` - silently drop the packet.
- `mark-packet` - mark the packet with the specified `new-packet-mark`.
- `mark-connection` - mark the connection with the specified `new-connection-mark`.
- `change-mss` - change the Maximum Segment Size field value of the packet to a value specified by the `new-mss` parameter.
- `change-dscp` - change the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field value specified by the `new-dscp` parameter.
- `change-ttl` - change the Time to Live field value of the packet to a value specified by the `new-ttl` parameter.
- `mark-routing` - place a mark specified by the `new-routing-mark` parameter on a packet. This kind of mark is used for policy routing purposes only. Do not apply any other routing marks besides `main` for packets processed by FastTrack, since FastTrack can only work in the main routing table.
- `set-priority` - set the priority of the packet.
- `clear-df` - clear the Don't Fragment flag.
- `fasttrack-connection` - mark the connection for FastTrack. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.
- `route` - forces packets to a gateway IP specified by 'route-dst' parameter, by ignoring normal routing decisions (prerouting chain only).
- `strip-ipv4-options` - strip IPv4 option fields from IP header. The action does not actually remove IPv4 options but rather replaces all option octets with NOP. Further matcher with `ipv4-options=any` will still match the packet.

<ArgTableRow arg="jump-target" typ="enum ()">Name of the target chain to jump to. Applicable only if `action=jump`.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="new-packet-mark" typ="enum ()">Sets the new packet mark value.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="new-connection-mark" typ="enum ()">Sets the new connection mark value.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="new-routing-mark" typ="enum ()">Sets a new `routing-mark` value. In RouterOS v7 routing mark must be created beforehand as a new [Routing table](https://manual.mikrotik.com/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/policy-routing.md)</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="new-mss" typ="alt { mss-action: enum (clamp-to-pmtu) { clamp-to-pmtu:65535 }
, mss-value: num [40 .. 65534]
 }">Sets a new MSS for a packet. **Important:** Clamp-to-pmtu feature sets the DF bit in the IP header to dynamically discover the PMTU of a path. The host sends all datagrams on that path with the DF bit set until it receives ICMP Destination Unreachable messages with a code meaning "fragmentation needed and DF set". Upon receipt of such a message, the source host reduces its assumed PMTU for the path.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="new-dscp" typ="enum (from-priority-to-high-3-bits | from-priority) { from-priority-to-high-3-bits:254, from-priority:255 }">Sets the new DSCP value.</ArgTableRow>

, new-priority: num [0 .. 63]
 }">Sets a new priority for a packet. This can be the VLAN, WMM, DSCP or MPLS EXP priority [Read more](https://manual.mikrotik.com/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/wmm-and-vlan-priority.md). This property can also be used to set an internal priority.</ArgTableRow>

 }
 }
 }">
Matches the specified TCP flags:
- `ack` - acknowledging data.
- `cwr` - congestion window reduced.
- `ece` - ECN-echo flag (explicit congestion notification).
- `fin` - close connection.
- `psh` - push function.

<ArgTableRow arg="connection-state" typ="super { !
, state: ubit (invalid, established, related, new, untracked)
 }">
Interprets the connection tracking analytics data for a particular packet:
 - `established` - a packet that belongs to an existing connection.
 - `invalid` - a packet that does not have a determined state in connection tracking (usually severe out-of-order packets, packets with wrong sequence/ack number, or in case of resource over usage on the router). An invalid packet will not participate in NAT (as only connection-state=new packets do), and will still contain the original source IP address when routed. You should drop all `connection-state=invalid` packets in the firewall filter forward and input chains.
 - `new` - the packet has started a new connection or is otherwise associated with a connection that has not seen packets in both directions.
 - `related` - a packet that is related to, but not part of an existing connection, such as ICMP errors or a packet that begins an FTP data connection.
 - `untracked` - a packet that was set to bypass connection tracking in firewall RAW tables.
</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="connection-nat-state" typ="super { !
, state: ubit (srcnat, dstnat)
 }">
Matches connections that are source-natted, destination-natted, or both. The `connection-state=related` connections' connection-nat-state is determined by the direction of the first packet, and if connection tracking needs to use dst-nat to deliver this connection to the same hosts as the main connection, it will be in connection-nat-state=dstnat even if there are no dst-nat rules at all.
`ein-snat` and `ein-dnat` are source and destination nated connections when endpoint-independent NAT is used.

<ArgTableRow arg="tls-host" typ="super { !
, tls-host: string
 }">Matches HTTPS traffic based on TLS SNI hostname. Accepts GLOB syntax for wildcard matching. The matcher will not be able to match the hostname if the TLS handshake frame is fragmented into multiple TCP segments.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="connection-limit" typ="super { !
, limit: num
, [netmask] ,num
 }">Matches connections per address or address block after a given value is reached. You should use this together with `connection-state=new` and/or with `tcp-flags=syn` because the matcher is very resource-intensive.</ArgTableRow>

<ArgTableRow arg="fragment" typ="super { fragment: bool
 }">Matches fragmented packets. The first (starting) fragment does not count. If connection tracking is enabled there will be no fragments as the system automatically assembles every packet. IPv4 only.</ArgTableRow>

 }">
How long the address stays in `address-list` after the `add-src-to-address-list` or `add-dst-to-address-list` action adds it. With a time, the rule adds a dynamic entry (`D`) that the router removes when the time ends; each new match of the rule resets the time to its full value. The maximum is `35w3d13h13m56s`. An address that is already a static entry in the list stays static.
- `none-dynamic` (`0s`) - Add a dynamic entry without a timeout. It is not saved in the configuration and a reboot clears it.
- `none-static` - Add a static entry. It is saved in the configuration and in exports, and stays after a reboot until you remove it.
