## routing/rip/instance 
**Type:** Directory

The maximum metric of a RIP route is 15. A metric higher than 15 is considered 'infinity' and routes with such a metric are considered unreachable. Thus RIP cannot be used on networks with more than 15 hops between any two routers, and using redistribute metrics larger than 1 further reduces this maximum hop count.
