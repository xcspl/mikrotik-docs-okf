## system/ntp/monitor-peers 
**Type:** Command

Continuously prints the client's view of its time sources, updating in place. Includes the local reference clock (127.127.1.0) when `use-local-clock` is enabled. See the [NTP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/ntp) guide.

<ArgTable c1="Read-only Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="type" typ="string">Association type, for example `ucast-client` for a unicast server.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="address" typ="address (flags=46)">Peer address from the server list, or 127.127.1.0 for the local reference clock.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="refid" typ="string">Reference ID: the time source of the peer (typically the address of the peer's own upstream source). Empty while the peer is unsynchronized.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="stratum" typ="num">Stratum announced by the peer. 16 means unsynchronized.</ArgTableRow>
