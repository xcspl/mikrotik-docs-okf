**Type:** Directory

Global Router ID election configuration. The Router ID can be configured explicitly or elected from one of the router's IP addresses.

For each VRF table, RouterOS adds a dynamic ID instance that elects the Router ID from one of the IP addresses in that VRF:

```text
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /routing/id> print
Flags: D - DYNAMIC, I - INACTIVE
Columns: NAME, DYNAMIC-ID, SELECT-DYNAMIC-ID, SELECT-FROM-VRF
#   NAME   DYNAMIC-ID      SELECT-D   SELE
0 D main   111.111.111.2   only-vrf   main

```

<ArgTable c1="Flag" c2="Name" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="X" typ="disabled">disabled</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="D" typ="dynamic">dynamic</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="I" typ="inactive">If there was a problem getting a valid ID, then the item can become inactive.</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="name" typ="string"></ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="id" typ="ipAddr" unset="1">Router ID to set explicitly. If the Router ID is not set, RouterOS can elect it from one of the configured IP addresses. See `select-dynamic-id` and `select-from-vrf`.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="select-dynamic-id" typ="ubit (any, only-static, only-loopback, only-vrf, only-active, lowest)" unset="1">
Select which IP addresses RouterOS uses for Router ID election:
- `any` - any address found on the router can be elected as the Router ID.
- `lowest` - select the lowest IP address.
- `only-static` - pick only statically configured addresses.
- `only-active` - select an ID only from active IP addresses.
- `only-loopback` - select an ID only from loopback addresses (loopback address is any non-point-to-point /32 address).
- `only-vrf` - select an ID only from the selected VRF. Works with `select-from-vrf`.
</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="select-from-vrf" typ="enum" unset="1">VRF from which to select IP addresses for the ID election.</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>
