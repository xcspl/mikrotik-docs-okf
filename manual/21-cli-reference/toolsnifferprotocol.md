**Type:** Directory

Packets and bytes of the last capture per MAC protocol, IP protocol and port, with each row's share of all captured bytes. A packet counts in every row it belongs to: for a TCP packet, the `ip` row, the `ip`/`tcp` row and a row for each of its ports. See [Packet sniffer](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/packet-sniffer).
