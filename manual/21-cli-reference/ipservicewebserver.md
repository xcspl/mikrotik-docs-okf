## ip/service/webserver 
**Type:** Settings Directory

Turns individual parts of the router's web server on or off, separately for HTTP (the `-plain` settings, served by the `www` service) and HTTPS (the `-secure` settings, served by `www-ssl`). All parts are enabled by default. A disabled part answers `403 Forbidden`, and the other parts keep working, so you can, for example, offer the REST API over HTTPS without WebFig. The port, allowed addresses and certificate of the web server are set in [`/ip/service`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ip/service/). For the REST API, see [REST API](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/rest-api).
