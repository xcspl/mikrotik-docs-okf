## interface/ethernet/switch/qos/port 
**Syscap:** rbswitch and crs_prestera
**Type:** Directory

This sub-menu configures QoS settings for individual switch ports. It allows you to assign a QoS profile to ingress packets arriving on a specific port. If the port is configured as trusted, the assigned profile can be overridden by match rules based on packet header values.

By default, all ports are untrusted and receive the default QoS profile (Best-Effort, PCP=0, DSCP=0). In this default state, priority fields are cleared from egress packets.

**Port Resources/Usage**

:::danger
Due to hardware limitations, some switch chip models may break traffic flow while accessing QoS port `usage` data. Use port `usage` for diagnostics/troubleshooting only. For monitoring, use QoS `monitor` or Port `stats` instead.
