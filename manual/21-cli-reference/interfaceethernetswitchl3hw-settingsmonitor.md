**Syscap:** rbswitch and crs_prestera
**Type:** Command

If the entire IPv4 routing table does not fit into the hardware memory, **partial offloading** is applied, where the longest prefixes are hw-offloaded while the shorter ones are redirected to the CPU. This field shows the shortest route prefix (/x) that is offloaded to the hardware memory. All prefixes shorter than this are processed by the CPU. `ipv4-shortest-hw-prefix=0` means the entire IPv4 routing table is offloaded to the hardware memory.</ArgTableRow>

<ArgTableRow arg="ipv6-routes-hw" typ="num">The number of hardware-offloaded IPv6 routes (a.k.a. hardware routes). Shown only when IPv6 hardware routing is enabled (`ipv6-hw=yes`).</ArgTableRow>

<ArgTableRow arg="route-queue-size" typ="num" syscap="!prestera-cpss">The number of routes in the queue for processing by the switch chip driver. Under normal working conditions, this field is 0, meaning that all routes are processed by the driver.</ArgTableRow>
