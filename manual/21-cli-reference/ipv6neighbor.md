## ipv6/neighbor 
**Type:** Directory

List of all discovered nodes by the IPv6 [Neighbor Discovery](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861) protocol, or nodes added manually by configuration.

The default maximum number of neighbor entries depends on installed RAM. Adjust it with `/ipv6/settings/set max-neighbor-entries=x`. See [IPv6 Settings](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/ipv6/settings.md) for details.

Status of the cached entry:
- **noarp** - the neighbor entry is valid. RouterOS does not validate this entry, but it can be removed when its lifetime expires.
- **incomplete** - address resolution is in progress and the neighbor's link-layer address is not yet determined.
- **reachable** - the neighbor was reachable recently (within tens of seconds).
- **stale** - the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable. Will continue sending traffic to the neighbor before attempting reachability verification.
- **delay** - the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable, and traffic has recently been sent to the neighbor. RouterOS delays probes briefly to allow the upper-layer protocol to confirm reachability.
- **probe** - the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable and unicast Neighbor Solicitation probes are being sent to verify reachability.
- **failed** - RouterOS could not resolve the neighbor's MAC address using the Neighbor Discovery protocol.
