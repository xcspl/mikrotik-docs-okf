## ip/neighbor 
**Type:** Directory

The neighbor list shows all discovered neighbors in the Layer 2 broadcast domain. It shows to which interface the neighbor is connected, its IP/MAC addresses, and other related parameters.

The number of neighbor entries is limited to (total RAM in megabytes) * 16 per interface to avoid memory exhaustion.
