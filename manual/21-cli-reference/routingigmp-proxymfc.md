Multicast forwarding cache (MFC) status.

RouterOS supports static multicast forwarding rules for IGMP proxy. If a static rule is added, all dynamic rules for that group will be ignored. These rules will take effect only if IGMP-proxy interfaces are configured (upstream and downstream interfaces should be set) otherwise these rules won't be active.
