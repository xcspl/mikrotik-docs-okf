## tool/sniffer 
**Type:** Settings Directory

Settings of the packet sniffer: which packets it captures (the `filter-*` settings), where it keeps them (memory and a file) and whether it streams them to a TZSP receiver. [`start`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/start) and [`quick`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/quick) without filter arguments use the saved filters. With filter arguments, they use only the filters given, for that run; the saved filters do not apply and do not change. See [Packet sniffer](https://manual.mikrotik.com/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/packet-sniffer).

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="only-headers" typ="bool">Store and save only the packet headers, not the payload. The packet list still shows the original packet size. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="memory-limit" typ="num">Memory for the captured packets, in KiB (10..4294967295). What does not fit is handled as `memory-scroll` says. Default: 100KiB.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="memory-scroll" typ="bool">What happens when `memory-limit` is reached: `yes` replaces the oldest packets with new ones, so the memory holds the latest packets; `no` keeps the first packets and stores no more. Default: yes.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="file-name" typ="file">File that the captured packets are written to while the sniffer runs, in pcapng format. Each start overwrites the file. A path on another disk, such as `usb1/capture.pcap`, writes the file there. Empty (default) keeps the packets only in memory; write them to a file later with [`save`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/save).</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="file-limit" typ="num">Size limit of `file-name`, in KiB (10..4294967295). When the file reaches the limit, the sniffer stops writing to it but keeps running. Default: 1000KiB.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="streaming-enabled" typ="bool">Send every captured packet to `streaming-server` as TZSP (version 1, Ethernet encapsulation, the whole frame) over UDP, for example to Wireshark. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="streaming-server" typ="composite { ip: ipAddr
, port: [ enum ()]
 }">Receiver of the TZSP stream: an address, or `address:port`. Without a port, 37008 is used. Default: 0.0.0.0:37008.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="max-packet-size" typ="num">Maximum packet size, in bytes (2048..65536). Default: 2048.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="filter-stream" typ="bool">With `yes`, the sniffer does not capture the packets it streams to `streaming-server`, and it does not capture ICMP packets to and from the `streaming-server` address either, also while streaming is off. Set `yes` when the interface towards the stream receiver is sniffed: with `no`, the stream packets are captured and streamed again, in a loop. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="filter-interface" typ="object { interface: iface_enum
 }">Interfaces to sniff. Empty (default) sniffs all interfaces; a packet to or from the router through a bridge then shows once on the bridge and once on the bridge port.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="filter-mac-address" typ="object { mac-address-element: super { !
, mac-address-with-mask: composite { mac: macAddr
