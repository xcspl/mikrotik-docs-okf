Action to take if a packet is matched by the rule:
- `accept` - accept the packet. A packet is not passed to the next firewall rule.
- `add-dst-to-address-list` - add the destination address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.
- `add-src-to-address-list` - add the source address to the address list specified by the `address-list` parameter.
- `jump` - jump to the user-defined chain specified by the value of the `jump-target` parameter.
- `log` - add a message to the system log containing the following data: in-interface, out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port-&gt;dst-ip:port, and length of the packet. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to `passthrough`.
- `passthrough` - if a packet is matched by the rule, increase the counter and go to the next rule (useful for statistics).
- `return` - passes control back to the chain from where the jump took place.
- `drop` - drop the packet.
- `notrack` - do not send a packet to connection tracking. Useful when you still need to use regular firewall, but do not require connection tracking.

- `time` - specifies the time interval in which the packet or bit rate cannot be exceeded (optional, 1s will be used if not specified).

 }">
How long the address stays in `address-list` after the `add-src-to-address-list` or `add-dst-to-address-list` action adds it. With a time, the rule adds a dynamic entry (`D`) that the router removes when the time ends; each new match of the rule resets the time to its full value. The maximum is `35w3d13h13m56s`. An address that is already a static entry in the list stays static.
- `none-dynamic` (`0s`) - Add a dynamic entry without a timeout. It is not saved in the configuration and a reboot clears it.
- `none-static` - Add a static entry. It is saved in the configuration and in exports, and stays after a reboot until you remove it.
