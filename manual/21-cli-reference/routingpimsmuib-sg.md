<ArgTable c1="Flag" c2="Name" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="K" typ="keepalive">keepalive</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="S" typ="spt-bit">The Shortest Path Tree (SPT) bit indicates whether forwarding is taking place on the (S,G) Shortest Path Tree or on the (\*,G) tree. A router can have an (S,G) state and still be forwarding on a (\*,G) state during the interval when the source-specific tree is being constructed. When the SPT bit is false, only the (\*,G) forwarding state is used to forward packets from S to G. When the SPT bit is true, both (\*,G) and (S,G) forwarding states are used.</ArgTableRow>
