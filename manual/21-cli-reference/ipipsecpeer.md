## ip/ipsec/peer 
**Type:** Directory

Peer configuration settings are used to establish connections between IKE daemons. This connection is then used to negotiate keys and algorithms for SAs. Exchange mode is the only unique identifier between the peers, meaning that multiple peer configurations can exist with the same remote-address as long as a different exchange-mode is used.

<ArgTable c1="Flag" c2="Name" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="X" typ="disabled">Whether an item is disabled.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="D" typ="dynamic">Whether the item was created dynamically.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="R" typ="responder">Whether this peer will act as a responder only (listen to incoming requests) and not initiate a connection.</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="name" typ="string">Peer name.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="address" typ="alt { prefix6: ip6Prefix
, prefix4: ipPrefix
, dns: string
 }">Remote address of the peer. If the remote peer's address matches this prefix, then the peer configuration is used in authentication and establishment of Phase 1. If several peer's addresses match several configuration entries, the most specific one (i.e. the one with the largest netmask) will be used.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="local-address" typ="alt { ipv6: ip6Addr
, ip: ipAddr
 }">Local address to use for the connection.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="passive" typ="bool">Passive peer does not initiate the connection. The enabled passive mode also indicates that the peer is an xauth responder, and disabled passive mode - xauth initiator.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="port" typ="num">Communication port used (when the router is an initiator) to connect to the remote peer when the remote peer uses a non-default port.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="profile" typ="enum">IPsec profile to use.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="exchange-mode" typ="enum (main | aggressive | ike2)">
ISAKMP phase 1 exchange modes according to [RFC 2408](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2408#section-4.1). The `main` mode relaxes [rfc2409 section 5.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2409#section-5.4), to allow pre-shared-key authentication in the `main` mode. `ike2` mode enables Ikev2 [RFC 7296](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7296).  

Parameters that are ignored by IKEv2: `proposal-check`, `compatibility-options`, `lifebytes`, `dpd-maximum-failures`, `nat-traversal`.
</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="send-initial-contact" typ="bool">Specifies whether to send an "initial contact" IKE packet or wait for the remote side, this packet should trigger the removal of old peer SAs for the current source address. Usually, in road warrior setups clients are initiators and this parameter should be set to no. Initial contact is not sent if modecfg or xauth is enabled for ikev1.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="ppk-secret" typ="string">Static PPK secret with "static-ppk-secret" ID used when no one-time key/psk exist for this peer, ensure the key has 256 bits of entropy.</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>

<ArgTable c1="Read-only Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="current-address" typ="alt { ipv6: ip6Addr
, ip: ipAddr
 }">Current remote address of the peer.</ArgTableRow>
