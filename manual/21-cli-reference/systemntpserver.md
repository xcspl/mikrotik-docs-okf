## system/ntp/server 
**Type:** Settings Directory

NTP server settings. The server answers time queries from NTP clients on the network; it serves the time the router itself is synchronized to. See the [NTP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/ntp) guide.

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="enabled" typ="bool">Enable the NTP server. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="broadcast" typ="bool">Periodically send the time to the addresses in `broadcast-addresses`. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="multicast" typ="bool">Distribute the time to the local network as multicast. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="manycast" typ="bool">Take part in manycast discovery, in which clients find servers through multicast queries. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="broadcast-addresses" typ="multi { broadcast-address: ipAddr
 }">Broadcast addresses to send the time to when `broadcast` is enabled.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="vrf" typ="enum">VRF the server operates in. Default: main.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="use-local-clock" typ="bool">Use the router's local clock as a time reference when no better source is available; the daemon then serves and follows its own clock at `local-clock-stratum`. The client's `status` shows `using-local-clock` in this state. The router's clock without external synchronization drifts, so do not use this for precise timekeeping. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="local-clock-stratum" typ="num">Stratum announced for the local clock when `use-local-clock` is enabled. Default: 5.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="auth-key" typ="enum (none) { none:0 }">Key from [`/system/ntp/key`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/ntp/key) for symmetric-key authentication of the time exchange. Default: none (no authentication).</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>
