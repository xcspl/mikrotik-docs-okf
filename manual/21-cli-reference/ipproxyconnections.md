## ip/proxy/connections 
**Type:** Directory

Open connections of the web proxy. Each connection from a client and each connection to a server is a row. The proxy keeps connections to servers open after a response and uses them for later requests. For an overview, see [Web Proxy](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/proxy/web-proxy).

<ArgTableRow arg="last-protocol" typ="enum (HTTP/1.0 | HTTP/1.1 | FTP) { HTTP/1.0:1, HTTP/1.1:2, FTP:3 }">Protocol of the last request on the connection: `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1` or `FTP`.</ArgTableRow>

State of the connection, for example:
- `waiting` - A client connection waits for the response from the server.
- `rx-header` - A server connection receives the header of the response.
- `idle` - A server connection is open and has no request.
