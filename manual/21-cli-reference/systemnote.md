## system/note 
**Type:** Settings Directory

A text that the router shows to administrators at login, for example the router's purpose, contacts or a warning. For examples, see [Note](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/note).

<ArgTable c1="Argument" c2="Type" c3="Description">
<ArgTableRow arg="show-at-login" typ="bool">Show the note after login: in interactive command-line sessions such as SSH or Telnet, right after the banner, and in WinBox. A command run over SSH without an interactive session does not show it. Default: yes.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="show-at-cli-login" typ="bool">Also show the note before the Telnet login prompt, to anyone who connects, without authentication; independent of `show-at-login`. SSH does not show the note before login, and MAC Telnet asks for the credentials before it connects. Default: no.</ArgTableRow>
<ArgTableRow arg="note" typ="string">Text of the note. `\n` starts a new line; `/system/note/edit note` opens the text in the built-in editor. A file named `sys-note.txt` in the root of the file storage replaces the note at the next startup, and the router then removes the file. Default: empty.</ArgTableRow>
</ArgTable>
