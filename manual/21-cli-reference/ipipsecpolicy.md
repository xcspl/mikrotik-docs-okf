## ip/ipsec/policy 
**Type:** Directory

:::info
Policy order is important. It works similarly to firewall filters where policies are executed from top to bottom (priority parameter is removed).

All packets are IPIP encapsulated in tunnel mode, and their new IP header's src-address and dst-address are set to sa-src-address and sa-dst-address values of this policy. If you do not use tunnel mode (i.e., you use transport mode), then only packets whose source and destination addresses are the same as sa-src-address and sa-dst-address can be processed by this policy. Transport mode can only work with packets that originate at and are destined for IPsec peers (hosts that established security associations). To encrypt traffic between networks (or a network and a host) you have to use tunnel mode.

Action to take for matching traffic.
- `none` - pass the packet unchanged.
- `discard` - drop the packet.
- `encrypt` - apply transformations specified in this policy and its SA.

<ArgTableRow arg="level" typ="enum (require | use | unique) { require:2, use:1, unique:3 }">
Specifies what to do if some of the SAs for this policy cannot be found:
- `use` - skip this transform, do not drop the packet, and do not acquire SA from IKE daemon;
- `require` - drop the packet and acquire SA;
- `unique` - drop the packet and acquire a unique SA that is only used with this particular policy. It is used in setups where multiple clients can sit behind one public IP address (clients behind NAT).
