# WinBox v3 (Legacy)

:::warning
This page documents the legacy WinBox v3 (Wine-based) application. MikroTik now provides **WinBox v4**, a native cross-platform application for Windows, Linux, and macOS. See the [WinBox v4 documentation](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox.md) for the current version.

:::

WinBox is a small utility that allows the administration of MikroTik RouterOS by using a fast and simple GUI. It is a native Win32/Win64 binary but can be run on **Linux** and **macOS (OSX)** by using Wine. All WinBox interface functions are as close as possible to mirroring the console functions, that is why there are no WinBox sections in the manual. Some advanced and system-critical configurations are not possible from WinBox, like a MAC address change on an interface.

From WinBox v3.14, the following security features are used:

- WinBox.exe is signed with an Extended Validation certificate, issued by SIA Mikrotīkls (MikroTik).
- WinBox uses ECSRP for key exchange and authentication (requires a new WinBox version).
- Both sides verify that the other side knows the password (no man-in-the-middle attack is possible).
- WinBox in RoMON mode requires that the agent is the latest version to be able to connect to the latest version routers.
- WinBox uses AES128-CBC-SHA as an encryption algorithm (requires WinBox v3.14 and later).

## Starting WinBox

WinBox loader can be downloaded from the [MikroTik download page](https://www.mikrotik.com/download). When WinBox.exe is downloaded, double-click it, and the WinBox loader window pops up. There are two WinBox loader modes: simple, which is enabled by default, and advanced.

### Simple mode

When you open the WinBox loader for the first time, the simple mode layout is used:

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-01.webp)

To connect to the router, enter the IP or MAC address of the router, specify the username and password (if any) and select the **Connect** button. You can also enter the port number after the IP address, separating them with a colon, like this 192.168.88.1:9999. The port can be changed in the RouterOS **services** menu.

:::warning
It is recommended to use an IP address whenever possible. A MAC session uses network broadcasts and is not 100% reliable.

:::

You can also use neighbor discovery to list available routers. Use the **Neighbors** tab:

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-02.webp)

From the list of discovered routers, you can select the IP or MAC address column to connect to that router. If you select the IP address then the IP is used to connect, but if you select the MAC Address then the MAC address is used to connect to the router.

:::info
Neighbor discovery shows also devices that are not compatible with WinBox, like Cisco routers or any other device that uses CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). If you try to connect to a SwOS device, then the connection is established through a web browser

:::

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-03.webp)

#### Buttons/check-boxes and Other Fields

Buttons/check-boxes

- **Browse** - Browse file directory for some specific session.
- **Keep Password** - If unchecked, the password is not saved to the list.
- **Secure mode** - If checked, WinBox uses DH-2048 for key exchange and modified and hardened RC4-drop3072 encryption to secure the session.
- **Autosave session** - Saves sessions automatically for devices to which connections are made.

Fields:

- **Session** - Saved router session.
- **Note** - Note that is assigned to saved router entry.
- **Group** - Group to which saved router entry is assigned.
- **RoMON Agent** - Select RoMON Agent from the available device list.

:::danger
The Managed routers list is encrypted, but it can still be loaded with another WinBox, **IF** the master password is not set for it!

:::

### Command Line

It is possible to use the command line to pass connect to, user, password and session ("workspace" for WinBox 4) parameters automatically:

```
winbox.exe [<connect-to> [<login> [<password>]] <session|workspace>]

```

For example (with no password):

```
winbox.exe 10.5.101.1 admin "" "<own>"

```

This connects to the router 10.5.101.1 with user "admin" without a password and use session|workspace "```<own>```".

It is possible to use the command line to pass the connect to, user, and password parameters automatically to connect to the router through RoMON. In this case, RoMON Agent must be saved on the Managed routers list so WinBox knows the user and password for this device:

```
winbox.exe --romon [<romon-agent> [<connect-to> [<login> [<password>]]] <session|workspace>]

```

For example (with no password):

```
winbox.exe --romon 10.5.101.1 D4:CA:6D:E1:B5:7D admin "" "<own>"

```

Connects to the router D4:CA:6D:E1:B5:7D, through 10.5.101.1 by using RoMON Agent with user "admin" without a password and apply session|workspace called "```<own>```".

### IPv6 connectivity

WinBox supports IPv6 connectivity. To connect to the router's IPv6 address, it must be placed in square brackets the same as in web browsers when connecting to the IPv6 server. Example:

[db8::1]

when connecting to the link-local address, the interface index must be entered after the %:

[0:a00:27ff:fe70::e88c%2]

Port number is set after the square brace when it is necessary to connect WinBox to a port other than the default:

WinBox neighbor discovery is capable of discovering IPv6 enabled routers. There are two entries for each IPv6 enabled router, one entry is with an IPv4 address and another one with an IPv6 link-local address. You can easily choose which one you want to connect to.

### Run WinBox on macOS

Starting with macOS 10.15 Catalina, Apple has removed support for 32bit applications, meaning it is no longer possible to use regular Wine and regular WinBox in this OS. Wine has made available a 64bit version for macOS, and MikroTik has released a special [WinBox64.exe](https://mt.lv/winbox64) version as well.

To run WinBox64 the following steps are required:

1. Install the latest Wine from the [Wine macOS builds page](https://github.com/Gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/releases) ( wine-devel-7.X-osx64.tar.xz) and make sure you have downloaded the [WinBox64.exe executable](https://mt.lv/winbox64) from the MikroTik download page.
2. Launch WinBox64.exe with "open file with" > Wine64.app.

### Run WinBox on Linux

It is possible to run WinBox on Linux by using Wine emulation software. Make sure that the Microsoft font pack is installed, otherwise, you may see distortions.

## Interface Overview

The WinBox interface has been designed to be intuitive for most of the users. The interface consists of:

- The main toolbar at the top where users can add various info fields, like CPU and memory usage.
- The menu bar on the left - list of all available menus and sub-menus. This list changes depending on what packages are installed. For example, if the IPv6 package is disabled, then the **IPv6** menu and all its sub-menus are not displayed.
- Work area - an area where all menu windows are opened.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-04.webp)

The title bar shows information to identify with which router the WinBox session is opened. Information is displayed in the following format:

```
[username]@[Router's IP or MAC] ( [RouterID] ) - WinBox [ROS version] on [RB model] ([platform])

```

From the screenshot, we can see that user **krisjanis** is logged into the router with IPv4/IPv6 address **[fe80::4e5e:cff:fef6:c0ab%3]**. Router's ID is **3C18-Krisjanis\_GW**, currently installed RouterOS version is **v6.36rc6**, RouterBoard is **CCR1036-12G-4S** and platform is **tile**.

On the Main toolbar's left side is located:

- **Undo**
- **Redo**
- **Safe Mode**
- Currently loaded session

More about Safe mode and undoing performed actions can be read [in this article](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management/index.md).

On the right side is located:

- An indicator that shows whether the WinBox session uses encryption.
- A WinBox traffic indicator displayed as a green bar.
- Custom info fields that can be added by the user by right-clicking on the toolbar and picking available info fields from the list.

## Work Area and Child Windows

WinBox has an MDI interface meaning that all menu configuration (child) windows are attached to the main (parent) WinBox window and are shown in the work area.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-05.webp)

Child windows can not be dragged out of the working area. In the screenshot, the **Interface** window is dragged out of the visible working area and a horizontal scroll bar appeared at the bottom. If any window is outside the visible work area boundaries the vertical and/or horizontal scrollbars appear.

### Child window menu bar

Each child window has its own toolbar. Most of the windows have the same set of toolbar buttons:

- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-06.webp) **Add** - add a new item to the list.
- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-07.webp) **Remove** - remove the selected item from the list.
- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-enable.png) **Enable** - enable the selected item (the same as **enable** command from console).
- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-disable.png) **Disable** - disable the selected item (the same as **disable** command from console).
- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-comment.png) **Comment** - add or edit a comment.
- ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-sort.png)  **Sort** - allows you to sort out items depending on various parameters.  [Sorting out displayed items](#sorting-out-displayed-items)

Almost all windows have a quick search input field on the right side of the toolbar. Any text entered in this field is searched through all the items and highlighted as illustrated in the following screenshot.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-08.webp)

Notice that on the right side next to the quick find input field there is a drop-down box. For the currently opened (IP Route) window, this drop-down box allows to quickly sort out items by routing tables. For example, if the **main** is selected, then only routes from the main routing table are listed.
A similar drop-down box is also in all firewall windows to quickly sort out rules by chains.

### Sorting out displayed items

Almost every window has a **Sort** button. When selecting this button, several options appear as illustrated in the following screenshot.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-09.webp)

The example shows how to quickly filter out routes that are in the 10.0.0.0/8 range:

1. Press the **Sort** button.
2. Choose **Dst.Address** from the first drop-down box.
3. Choose **in** from the second drop-down box. "in" means that the filter checks if DST address value is in range of the specified network.
4. Enter the network against which values are compared (in our example enter "10.0.0.0/8").
5. These buttons are to add or remove another filter to the stack.
6. Press the **Filter** button to apply our filter.

As you can see from the screenshot, WinBox sorted out only routes that are within the 10.0.0.0/8 range.

Comparison operators (Number **3** in the screenshot) may be different for each window. For example, the "IP Route" window has only two: **is** and **in**. Other windows may have operators such as "is not", "contains", "contains not".

WinBox allows building a stack of filters. For example, if there is a need to filter by destination address and gateway, then:

- Set the first filter as described in the previous example.
- Press the **[+]** button to add another filter bar in the stack.
- Set up a second filter to filter by the gateway.
- Press the **Filter** button to apply filters.

You can also remove unnecessary filters from the stack by pressing the **[-]** button.

### Customizing list of displayed columns

By default, WinBox shows the most commonly used parameters. However, sometimes it is needed to see other parameters, for example, "BGP AS Path" or other BGP attributes to monitor if routes are selected properly.

WinBox allows you to customize displayed columns for each individual window. For example, to add the BGP AS path column:

- Select the little arrow button (**1**) on the right side of the column titles or right-click on the route list.
- From the pop-up menu move to **Show Columns** (**2**) and from the sub-menu pick the desired column, in our case select **BGP AS Path** (**3**).

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-10.webp)

Changes made to the window layout are saved and the next time WinBox is opened the same column order and size are applied.

#### Detail mode

It is also possible to enable **Detail mode**. In this mode all parameters are displayed in columns, the first column is the parameter name, the second column is the parameter's value.

To enable detail mode, right-click on the item list and from the popup menu pick **Detail mode**

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-11.webp)

#### Category view

It is possible to list items by categories. In this mode, all items are grouped alphabetically or by another category. For example, items may be categorized alphabetically if sorted by name, and items can also be categorized by type like in the following screenshot.

To enable Category view, right-click on the item list and from the popup menu pick **Show Categories**.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-12.webp)

### Drag & Drop

It is possible to upload and download files to/from the router using WinBox drag & drop functionality. You can also download the file by pressing the right mouse button on it and selecting "Download".

:::info
Drag & Drop works if WinBox is running on Linux using wine4. Drag and drop between two WinBox windows may fail.

:::

### Traffic monitoring

WinBox can be used as a tool to monitor the traffic of every interface, queue, or firewall rule in real-time. The following screenshot shows Ethernet traffic monitoring graphs.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-13.webp)

### Item copy

This shows how easy it is to copy an item in WinBox. In this example, use the COPY button to make a Dynamic PPPoE server interface into a Static interface.

This image shows us the initial state. As you see, DR indicates "D" which means Dynamic:

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-14.webp)

Double-click on the interface and select COPY:

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-15.webp)

A new interface window appears, and a new name is created automatically (in this case pppoe-in1).

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-16.webp)

After this Down/Up event this interface is Static:

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/winbox-17.webp)

## Transferring Settings

- Managed router transfer - In the File menu, use Save As and Open functions to save the managed router list to a file and open it up again on a new workstation.

- Router sessions transfer - In the Tools menu, use Export and Import functions to save existing sessions to a file and import them again on a new workstation.

## Troubleshooting

### WinBox cannot connect to the router's IP address, devices do not show up in the Neighbors list

Make sure that the Windows firewall is set to allow WinBox connections through Private and/or Public network interfaces in the Windows firewall. It can be changed in *Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall\Allowed applications*. Or disable the Windows firewall.

### I get an error '(port 20561) timed out' when connecting to the router's MAC address

Windows (7/8) does not allow MAC connection if file and print sharing is disabled.

### I can't find my device in WinBox IPv4 Neighbors list or MAC connection fails with "ERROR could not connect to XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX"

Most of the network drivers do not enable IP stack unless your host device has an IP configuration. Set IPv4 configuration on your host device.

*Sometimes the device is discovered due to caching, but MAC connection still fails with "ERROR: could not connect to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX".*

:::warning
WinBox MAC-ADDRESS connection requires an MTU value set to 1500, unfragmented. Other values can perform poorly - loss of connectivity can occur.
