# FlashFig

### Description

FlashFig is a Windows‑based utility designed for high‑volume configuration of MikroTik RouterBOARDs. It is intended for use by MikroTik distributors, Internet Service Providers, and other organizations that must deploy RouterOS configurations to multiple devices rapidly.

When a RouterBOARD is placed in flash‑boot mode and powered on within a Layer‑2 broadcast domain that hosts FlashFig, the application transmits the target RouterOS configuration file to the device in about three seconds. Consequently, a batch of routers can be provisioned concurrently by connecting each RouterBOARD to the same Layer‑2 network and supplying power to the FlashFig‑enabled units.

The FlashFig utility is downloadable from the MikroTik [Downloads](https://mikrotik.com/download) page.

FlashFig mode is enabled by default on all RouterBOARD units manufactured since March 2010. For older models, FlashFig can be activated by setting the [`boot-device`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/system/routerboard/settings#boot-device) to `flash‑boot` or `flash‑boot‑once‑then‑nand` in RouterBOARD settings:
```ros
/system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot-once-then-nand
# or
/system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot
```

:::info
After every system reset initiated from the software or when you reset the router with the reset button, flash boot mode is initiated.  
If you press and hold the reset button before powering on the router, then the backup booter is used.
:::

FlashFig mode on a brand new RouterBOARD is disabled on further boots only after the first successful user login or successful FlashFig attempt to avoid unwanted reconfiguration at a later time. To use FlashFig a second time on the same router, you need to enable **flash-boot** in RouterBOARD settings (this setting reverts to NAND after a successful configuration change or once any user logs into the board).

If the RouterOS *reset-configuration* command is used later (or configuration reset using the Reset button), FlashFig configuration is loaded. To permanently overwrite, use the Netinstall process and check *Apply default configuration* or use the *-r* flag in the Linux-based command line.

Starting from RouterOS/FlashFig 7.22, you can configure **device‑mode** and **protected‑routerboot** and other settings by using the Mode script. The Mode script executes before any custom or default configuration scripts. Upon completion, the script is automatically removed from the device. If the script modifies the device-mode, the device is rebooted immediately after execution.

You can view the FlashFig [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gticPeOdN54) on the MikroTik YouTube channel.

### FlashFig Example

This is a step-by-step example of how to use the FlashFig process to apply a chosen MikroTik RouterOS configuration to a 'factory fresh' RouterBOARD.

#### Requirements

The Windows computer must be equipped with the following ports and contain the following files:

- A working Ethernet port.
- Valid *Config* and/or *Mode* script file with MikroTik RouterOS configuration similar to an [export/import file](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management#configuration-export-and-import). In addition to valid MikroTik RouterOS CLI commands, you can also re-apply the factory passwords by using the read-only variables *$defconfPassword* and *$defconfWifiPassword*;
- Always use the latest FlashFig program available from the [downloads](https://mikrotik.com/download) page.
- The RouterBOARD has to be in flash-boot mode. If this is the very first boot, nothing needs to be done.

:::info
Be aware of the text editor's treatment of CR/LF characters and test that the config has no errors when normally applied onto an identical version of RouterOS before applying by using FlashFig, as run-time errors are not visible!
:::

#### Pre-Configuration

##### Windows Computer

- Run FlashFig.
- Prepare *Config* and/or *Mode* script **.rsc** file/s. *Config* and/or *Mode* script file is a [regular/import file](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management#configuration-export-and-import), it accepts valid MikroTik RouterOS CLI commands. You can create a .rsc file with any text editor program (Notepad, Notepad++, Text Editor, TextEdit, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer).

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/editor_1.png)

- Assign **Boot Client Address**, which should be an address within *the same subnet as that configured on the computer's Ethernet interface*.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/flashfig_1.png)

- **Browse** for *Config* and/or *Mode* script **.rsc** files

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/flashfig_2.png)

- Highlight *Config* script file and **Select Config**, highlight *Mode* script file and **Select Mode**.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/flashfig_3.png)

- Activate FlashFig server. Now it is ready to FlashFig. Any RouterBOARD is FlashFig'ed within the network when it is powered on with boot-device configured to **flash-boot** or **flash-boot-once-then-nand**.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/flashfig_4.png)

##### RouterBOARD

- FlashFig mode is enabled on every RouterBOARD from the factory by default, which means **no configuration** is required on the RouterBOARD.

- If FlashFig is not enabled on your router, access the RouterBOARD with WinBox/Console and change the boot-device to *flash-boot* or *flash-boot-once-then-nand*:

```ros
/system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot
```

Or use a more preferable option, for a single boot flash-boot:

```ros
/system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot-once-then-nand
```

Your router is now ready for FlashFig.

##### Connect

Connect the ***Boot*** port of RouterBOARD and the FlashFig computer to the same Local Area Network.

##### Run FlashFig

- Plug in power for RouterBOARD.
- Check the status on the FlashFig program.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/flashfig_5.png)

Messages log shows "Flashfigged" and RouterBOARD repeatedly makes the morse code sound for the character "/" ("\_..\_." and flashes the LED) - it is now safe to unplug / power down the router:

- FlashFig **configuration** was applied to the RouterBOARD and it is **ready** to be used in production with this new config.

### Troubleshoot

#### FlashFig can not find a router

If between a PC and a router there is another device (a router/switch), ensure that for this device:

- DHCP server is disabled.
- If used ports are in a bridge, set bridge *protocol-mode* to *none*.
- HW-offload for used ports is disabled.

#### FlashFig finds a router, flashing is not done (no TFTP request)

Ensure that the computer on which FlashFig is running has only one network interface active.

#### FlashFig is done, but a configuration is not applied

If all procedures went successfully, but RouterOS configuration from the .rsc file is not applied, add [startup delay](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management#startup-delay) to the \*.rsc configuration file. The reason might be that the configuration script is executed before all interfaces boot up.

#### Not enough flash space, ignoring

FlashFig configuration maximum file size is up to 4000 bytes, otherwise the program returns an error as described previously.
