# WinBox

## Summary

WinBox is a utility that allows the administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI. WinBox v4 is a native application available for Windows, Linux, and macOS — no Wine or emulation required. All WinBox interface functions mirror the console functions as closely as possible, which is why there are no separate WinBox sections in the manual.

The following security features are used:

- WinBox is signed with an Extended Validation certificate issued by SIA Mikrotīkls (MikroTik).
- WinBox uses ECSRP for key exchange and authentication.
- Both sides verify that the other side knows the password (no man-in-the-middle attack is possible).
- WinBox uses AES128-CBC-SHA as an encryption algorithm.

:::info
WinBox v4 replaces the legacy Windows-based WinBox v3. If you are still using the older version, see the [WinBox v3 (Legacy)](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox-legacy.md) page.

## Login interface

This section covers the login interface. It is the first thing you will see when launching the WinBox application. From here you can connect to the RouterOS device manually using the login section, or use saved credentials from the **Saved** tab. For more convenient discovery of devices in the L2 network connected to the PC running WinBox, the **Neighbors** tab can be used.
The Login interface ([see Figure 1](#figure-1---login-interface)) can be divided into two sections:

- **Login section** - the part on the left, used for connecting to the RouterOS.
- **Device list section** - the part on the right, contains saved or discovered devices, and can be further divided into three tabs.
  - **Saved** - user saved devices.
  - **Neighbors** - discovered devices.
  - **RoMON** - RoMON discovered devices.

Elements that are not covered by the above sections can be found in [Table 3](#table-3---miscellaneous-elements).

(works only with the **Connect** button, not with **Connect to RoMON** button)|
| ![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/new_winbox_table_2_7.webp) | **Save to list** - Allows to save router credentials to the Saved list. Additional parameters:  - **Group** - the group the entry will belong to, which allows for easier sorting of saved entries  - **Comment** - allows to add device description or other useful information  - **with password** - when enabled, the password is saved along with other credentials. If disabled, the password must be entered manually each time a saved entry is used.|

:::warning
To connect to the device, use an IP address whenever possible. A MAC session uses network broadcasts and is not 100% reliable.
:::

### Device list section

Device list section is used for navigating lists of saved and discovered devices.

#### Figure 3 - Saved device list

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/new_winbox_4_saved_device_list.webp)

Save frequently accessed routers in the **Saved** tab. Each entry can include:

- **Address** - Address field. Supported address formats are: MAC, IPv4, [IPv6], domain name. (IPv6 should specifically be used in square brackets) You can also enter a custom port after the IP address, separated by a colon (e.g., `192.168.88.1:9999`). The port can be changed in the RouterOS [Services](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/services) menu.
- **User** - username for authentication.
- **Password** - password for authentication. (not shown in the table for security reasons)
- **Group** - group the entry belongs to.
- **Comment** - device description or other useful information.

Database path shows (in the bottom right corner of [Figure 3](#figure-3---saved-device-list)) the location on your PC where the currently opened device list's .cdb file is stored. All **Actions** in this list are used for this database management.

**Actions** available for this list:

- **Open** - opens saved device list from exported .cdb file of your choice
- **Move** - moves current .cdb file to different directory of your choice
- **Import** - overrides current .cdb file with saved device list from exported .cdb file of your choice
- **Export** - exports saved device list from current .cdb file, so it can be used with **Import** or **Open**
- **Set file password** - encrypts current .cdb file with a password

#### Figure 4 - Neighbors device list

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/img/new_winbox_5_neighbor_device_list.webp)

## Troubleshooting

##### WinBox cannot connect to the router's IP address, devices do not show up in the Neighbors list

Make sure the firewall is set to allow WinBox connections through Private and/or Public network interfaces. On Windows, this can be configured in *Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall\Allowed applications*.

##### MAC connection fails with error "(port 20561) timed out"

Windows does not allow MAC connection if file and print sharing is disabled.

##### MAC connection fails with "ERROR could not connect to XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX"

Most network drivers require an IP configuration before enabling the IP stack. Set an IPv4 configuration on the host device.

:::warning
WinBox MAC address connection requires an MTU value set to 1500, unfragmented. Other values may cause poor performance or connectivity loss.
