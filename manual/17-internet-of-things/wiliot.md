# Wiliot

**[Wiliot](https://www.wiliot.com/company)** is an **Internet of Things** company that is known for their [IoT Pixels](https://www.wiliot.com/product/iot-pixels) (labels) amongst other solutions. The great benefit of the pixel is that it is a battery free and label-size (compact) Bluetooth "tag" (that broadcasts Bluetooth beacons with telemetry data).

- To power the IoT Pixel, you need a bridge ("energizer") device. It provides "energy" over radio waves and powers the IoT pixels from a distance.
- To forward IoT Pixel's data to the server ("dashboard"), you need a gateway device. It establishes the connection with the server using a TCP/IP connection, and forwards label's payloads that contain sensor's data (like temperature).

Both operation modes can be performed by a single device, or by separate devices.

RouterOS allows the usage of Wiliot `gateway` and `bridge` modes on devices that have Bluetooth support.

Wiliot `gateway` mode is responsible for establishing the connection with the MQTT server (by registering the gateway through the API, obtaining required tokens and credentials, and authorizing the device). It is also responsible for forwarding Pixel's Bluetooth payloads that it captures over the air via the established MQTT connection, and for relaying additional commands it might get from the subscribed MQTT topic via Bluetooth advertising.

Wiliot `bridge` mode is responsible for providing energy over the frequency and keeping the IoT Pixels powered.

:::warning
`bridge` mode is not implemented yet.

## Step by step

Step by step requires two quick steps:

1. To register the device and activate the MikroTik board;
2. To set up IoT Pixels.

### Step #1, Gateway Registration

#### On the Wiliot portal

- Login to the Wiliot registration page →  [https://deployment-tool.wiliot.com](https://deployment-tool.wiliot.com)

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/internet-of-things/img/wiliot-01.webp)

- Select "Gateway Registration".
- Select "Manual input" (top right corner of the screen).
- Enter "Gateway ID".

You can copy "Gateway ID" from the RouterOS settings (`gateway-id` field):

```routeros
[admin@MikroTik] > /iot wiliot configuration print
                  status: inactive                
              gateway-id: XXXXXXXXX          
                    type: mikrotik-knot-embedded
                   owner: xxxx              
               spoof-gps: xx                   
                     lat: xx                    
                    long: xx                    
  token-refresh-handicap: 3600                  
                  server: Wiliot US East        
                 scanner: bt1                   
              advertiser: bt1                   
                   wi-fi: none                  
                features: gateway  
```

- The new gateway should appear on the platform in the "pre-registered" state → [https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways](https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways)

#### In the RouterOS

:::info
You can navigate the settings using different tools. The advised way of management is by using [Winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox.md) software. [Download the tool using this link](https://mikrotik.com/download/winbox) and run it. Connect your PC with an "ethernet" cable to any port beginning with ether2+ (avoid using ether1 as, in most cases, it is configured as a WAN port and is restricted by the firewall, while the rest of the ports are LAN ports with open access and DHCP-server enabled), or connect using Wi-Fi (if the board has a Wi-Fi chip).

In Winbox, navigate to the "Neighbors" tab (Select from: Neighbors), find the MAC-address of your MikroTik board (which is printed on the label on the device), click on the MAC-address, enter login credentials (also printed on the label) and "connect" to it.

From here, you can use "GUI" or "CLI" commands. **The guide shows "CLI" command examples**, which you can run by opening "New Terminal" from the Winbox options. However, the exact same sections and tabs are available in GUI as well. For example, if the command is shown as "**`/iot/wiliot/enable`**", go to the **IoT→ Wiliot** tab and click on the "**enable**" button.
:::

- Enable "wiliot" functionality.

```routeros
[admin@MikroTik] > /iot/wiliot/enable
```

- Confirm that the device successfully obtained a token, was authorized and connected to the MQTT server with the "**active**" status (`status: active`).

```routeros
[admin@MikroTik] > /iot/wiliot/configuration/print
                  status: active                  
              gateway-id: XXXXXXXXX           
                    type: mikrotik-knot-embedded
                   owner: xxxx              
  token-refresh-handicap: 3600                  
                  server: Wiliot US East        
                 scanner: bt1                   
              advertiser: bt1                   
                   wi-fi: none                  
                features: gateway               
```

 Gateway status should change from "pre-registered" to "approved" (or/and to "online") on the Wiliot platform → [https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways](https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways)

### Step #2, Adding IoT Pixel (label)

#### On the Wiliot portal

- Login to the Wiliot platform and navigate to the "Category" tab → [https://platform.wiliot.com/categories](https://platform.wiliot.com/categories). Add a new "Category" ("Add new"). Name it and select a required category type.
- Navigate to the "Pixels" tab → [https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/pixels](https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/pixels). Check the "ID" of your label. Labels should be already assigned to your account.
- Go to "Assets" tab → [https://platform.wiliot.com/assets](https://platform.wiliot.com/assets). Create a new asset ("Add New"). Select/link the asset to the previously created "Category", enter "Asset ID" (or generate a random one) and select pixel's ID from the list.
- By clicking on the created "asset" entry (once the label is energized and gateway is ready), you will be able to see label's readings (temperature, etc.).

## RouterOS settings

**Sub-menu:** `/iot/wiliot`

***note**:* **iot** package is required.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **configuration** | General Wiliot gateway/bridge settings. |
| **servers** | MQTT server configuration. |
| **bluetooth traffic** | Bluetooth traffic menu. |
| **mqtt traffic** | MQTT traffic menu. |

### Configuration (General options)

To enable the configuration, use the command:

```routeros
/iot/wiliot/enable
```

To disable it:

```routeros
/iot/wiliot/disable
```

To clear (purge) MQTT connection/authentication data (only usable when "disabled"):

```routeros
/iot/wiliot/disable
/iot/wiliot/clear
```

:::info
After "clearing" the configuration, you will have to delete the gateway ([https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways](https://platform.wiliot.com/edge/gateways)) and re-register the gateway anew ([https://deployment-tool.wiliot.com/](https://deployment-tool.wiliot.com/)).
:::

Configuration properties can be applied using the "set" command (only usable when "disabled"):

```routeros
/iot/wiliot/set
```

Example:

```routeros
/iot/wiliot/set features=gateway
```

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **advertiser** (Default: bt1) | Select Bluetooth interface which will be used for advertising (relaying commands obtained from the MQTT server). |
| **scanner** (Default: bt1) | Select Bluetooth interface which will be used for scanning (capturing Pixel's payloads). |
| **spoof-gps** (*yes \| no*; Default: no) | Choose whether to use manual GPS coordinates, which are going to be delivered to the server. |

```

### Debugging

You can enable "wiliot" debug logging, using the command:

```routeros
/system/logging
add topics=wiliot
```

As a result, you should see more detailed entries in the logs (`/log/print` command):

```routeros

```

### Certificates

Wiliot functionality initiates HTTP posts using [/tool/fetch](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/fetch.md) and establishes an MQTT connection using [/mqtt](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/internet-of-things/mqtt/index.md). Both HTTP and MQTT require SSL certificates. RouterOS has a "builtin trust store" which contains all the required certificates from the get-go.

**[By default](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates.md#settings),** "**all**" **services should be allowed to use the built-in certificate store**, so you do not have to do anything. However, if you decide to restrict that (if you decide not to allow "all" services to have access to the "store"), for "wiliot" to work, you need to enable "wiliot", "mqtt" and "fetch" services (or disable builtin-trust-store and upload certificates manually):

```routeros
[admin@MikroTik] > /certificate/settings/print
  builtin-trust-store: fetch                    
                       mqtt                      
                       wiliot                     
         crl-download: no    
              crl-use: no    
            crl-store: ram 
```
