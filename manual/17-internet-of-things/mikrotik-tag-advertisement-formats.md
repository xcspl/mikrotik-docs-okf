## Introduction

TG-BT5-XX tags can operate in 4 different modes:

- Factory sleep mode
- Configuration mode
- Advertising mode
- Upgrade mode

In advertising mode, the tag will broadcast information about itself in Bluetooth advertising packets. The information depends on the advertising packet type.

At the moment, these are all the supported types that can be configured using the MikroTik Beacon Manager app:

DeviceName, MikroTik, [Eddystone-TLM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikrotik.android.bt5&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1), [Eddystone-UID](https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-uid) and [iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/).

Bluetooth technology uses 2 types of channels (each using different frequencies) during the data exchange:

- Data channels dedicated to data transmission;
- Advertise channels dedicated to advertising.

There are 40 unique bands (channels) and each band has a 2 MHz separation. 37, 38, and 39 channels are used for advertising, and 0-36 are used for data transmission.

During the advertising process, the BLE advertising packet is broadcasted. This packet contains the Preamble, Access Address, PDU and CRS fields.

The Preamble and Access Address fields help the receiver detect frames. CRS field is used to check errors. PDU defines the packet itself.

MikroTik tags support legacy Non-Connectable Non-Scannable Undirected advertising (`ADV_NOCONN_IND`). The Payload, in this case, consists of "AdvA" (a field that contains information about the advertiser's address) and "AdvData" (a field that contains data information) fields.

1 octet = 1 byte = 8 bits

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Preamble | 1 octet |
| Access-Address | 4 octets |
| PDU |PDU Header = 2 octets PDU Payload = AdvA (6 octets)+AdvData (0...31 octets)|
| CRS | 3 octets |

## MikroTik packet structure

"AdvData" field structure (max 31 octets/bytes):

| Property | Description | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flags | Flags field's length, type and data. Is used to "tell" surrounding scanners in which state the device is in. | 3 octets (`020106`):  1st octet - length  2nd octet - type 3d octet - data|
| Length | Length of the payload. | 1 octet (`15`) |
| Type | Manufacturer specific data. | 1 octet (`ff`) |
| ManufacturerData | Company identifier. | 2 octets (`4F09`) |
| Version | The version of this advertisement structure. | 1 octet (uint) |
| UserData | User-configured part of the payload. | 1 octet (uint) |
| Secret | Optionally encrypted (AES-ECB) part of the payload. |  secret: salt (for encryption) = 2 octets (uint)  secret: acceleration (acceleration in signed 8.8 fixed point format  acceleration of all 3 axis (0=x, 1=y, 2=z)) = 6 octets (uint)  secret: temperature (ambient temperature in Celsius in signed 8.8 fixed point format) = 2 octet (int)  secret: uptime (uptime in seconds) = 4 octets (uint)  secret: flags (bit-mask of flags) = 1 octet (uint)  secret: batteryPercentage (battery level in percent) = 1 octet (uint)  |

:::info
Note that all multi-byte values are in little-endian. Meaning, that if, for example, you want to get the temperature value and #14 and #15 octets indicate the temperature as "a1 19" ("plus" temperature) → the real temperature value is going to be (0x19a1)/256 = 25.6 C.
:::
A detailed example of how you can convert **hexadecimal** payload's values to **decimal** values will be shown later in the **PDU payload structure** section.

UserData and Secret fields are configured with the help of `flags`. In the "UserData" section, the parameter that controls whether the "Secret" is encrypted or not is called `FLAG_ENCRYPTED`. When `FLAG_ENCRYPTED=0`, it means the secret is not encrypted (1st bit in 6th octet would be set to 0), and when `FLAG_ENCRYPTED=1`, it means the secret is encrypted (1st bit in 6th octet would be set to 1).

In the "Secret" section, there are 7 `flags` (24st octet):

- `FLAG_REED_SWITCH` (1st bit - if set to 1, shows that the reed switch was closed at the moment of advertising)
- `FLAG_ACCEL_TILT` (2nd bit - if set to 1, shows that the advertisement was sent by tilting the device)
- `FLAG_ACCEL_FREE_FALL` (3d bit - if set to 1, shows that the advertisement was sent by dropping the device)
- `FLAG_IMPACT_X` (4th bit - if set to 1, shows that there was an impact on the x-axis at the moment of advertising)
- `FLAG_IMPACT_Y` (5th bit - if set to 1, shows that there was an impact on the y-axis at the moment of advertising)
- `FLAG_IMPACT_Z` (6th bit - if set to 1, shows that there was an impact on the z-axis at the moment of advertising)
- `FLAG_ACCEL_DISABLED` (7th bit - if set to 1, shows that acceleromater was disabled)
For example, if you see that the 24st octet of the hex message is "02" (when converting the value "02" from **hexadecimal** to **binary** it is "0010" → 2nd bit is set to 1) → it means that the device was tilted. If you see "04" (**hex** "04" to **bin** is "0100" → 3d bit is set to 1) → it means that the device was dropped (freefalling triggered). If you see "38" (**hex** to **bin** it is "00111000" → 4th, 5th, and 6th bits are set to 1) →  it means that when the advertisement was sent, the accelerometer detected an impact/wake-up on all 3 x/y/z-axis.

More examples (for 24 octet's value):

- "08" is the impact on just the x-axis;
- "18" is the impact on the x and y-axis;
- "28" is the impact on the x and z-axis;
- "10" is the impact on just the y-axis;
- "30" is the impact on y and z-axis;
- "20" is the impact on just the z-axis.
- "40" indicates disabled accelerometer.

#### Example

An example of the payload configured in MikroTik's format (non-encrypted) would be:

| 02010615ff4f090100cea6000000000200a01c91085700005f |
| --- |

**020106** (first 3 octets) → Flags field's length, type and data.

**15ff4f09** (4th, 5th, 6th and 7th octets) → Length (0x15 **hex-to-dec** is 21). Type (0xff). Company identifier (0x4f09).

**01** (8th octet)  →  Current version of the payload's structure. Should be the same for every payload (constant data).

**00** (9th octet) → Indicates that the payload is not encrypted. "01" would mean it is encrypted.

**cea6** (10th and 11th octets) → Salt. Each new payload should have a different salt value generated. You can use this value to check whether the identical payloads are encrypted differently. **The value itself does not contain any useful information**. If you see that the salt value is identical for two payloads received during different time intervals, it would mean that the two payloads received are exactly identical. You can calculate the salt value using the same principle that applies to the uptime calculation - see below.

**0000**(12th and 13th octets) → acceleration on the X-axis at the moment of the broadcast = **0 m/s<sup>2</sup>**. Check acceleration calculation for the Z-axis below.

**0000** (14th and 15th octets) → acceleration on the Y-axis at the moment of the broadcast = **0 m/s<sup>2</sup>**. Check acceleration calculation for the Z-axis below.

**0200** (16th and 17th octets) → acceleration on the Z-axis at the moment of the broadcast = **0.0078 m/s<sup>2</sup>**. To get the decimal value out of the hex format you will need to follow the steps:

- As noted before, multi-byte values are in little-endian and that means, to calculate the realm value, you will need to switch octets places (switch octets order). So the first step is to swap places for the values from 0x**0200** to 0x**0002**. 0x**0002** converted from **hexadecimal** to **decimal** is **02**.
- Keep in mind that acceleration is in signed 8.8 fixed point format (two's complement) and that means that you basically need to divide the result by "256". The second step is to divide the value by 256 → (0x**0002** **hex** or **02** **dec**)/256 = 0.0078 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
- The same calculation principle applies to the acceleration for the X and Y-axis. In our example, they just happen to be 0 → 0x0000/256=0.

**a01c** (18th and 19th octets) → temperature detected by the tag in Celsius = **28.625 C**. Temperature is in little-endian (as it is a multi-byte value) and it is in **signed 16-bit integer [twos complement] 8.8 fixed point format**, so the same "formula" applies here as well:
0x1ca0/256=28.625 C.

**91085700**(20th, 21st, 22nd, 23d octets) → tag's uptime in seconds = **5703825 s**. 0x91085700 is in little-endian, so just swap the octets to 0x00570891 and the result is 5703825 in decimal. That is 1584.395833 hours or 66-day uptime.

**00** (24th octet) → trigger (flag) that sent the payload. If it is "**00**" it means that no trigger was detected and that it is just a periodically broadcasted payload (based on the advertisement interval configured for the tag). If the value would be "**04**" it would mean that the device was dropped (freefalling triggered). You can find more information on the "flags" and the "Secret" section above in the **packet structure** section.

**5f** (25th octet) → battery percentage of the tag = **95 %**. 0x**5f** from hex to dec is 95.

The only line that you need to alter is the:

```
:local addressRegex "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A"
```

line, where you need to input the MAC address of the tag.

Save the script with whichever name you like, for example, **decode**.

Run the script via the command line interface ("**New Terminal**" button in Winbox/Webfig):

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > system script run decode
0: address=2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A ts=1662553431348 rssi=-45 version=1 encrypted=0 salt=57919 accelX=3 accelY=-35 accelZ=-70 temp=25535 uptime=1046174 flags="" bat=99
1: address=2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A ts=1662553436349 rssi=-40 version=1 encrypted=0 salt=24154 accelX=-19 accelY=-23 accelZ=0 temp=25546 uptime=1046179 flags="" bat=99
2: address=2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A ts=1662553446351 rssi=-37 version=1 encrypted=0 salt=37822 accelX=-15 accelY=35 accelZ=15 temp=25550 uptime=1046189 flags="" bat=99
```

As you can see from the example above, the script will "translate" all payloads from a **hexadecimal** format to a **decimal** format and print them into the terminal.

You can also alter the script further to structure a message out of the "already decoded" values and post it to an EMAIL, MQTT, or HTTP server of your choice **but!** please keep in mind that it might load the device more. So you need to test the performance when running the script. It will be easier on RouterOS resources when the decoding is done on the server side.
:::info
Because of the fact that floating point is not supported → every calculation behind a decimal point will be "rounded up" to a whole number. This is why the script will calculate the temperature and acceleration values **scaled by 1000** (multiplied by **1000**).
So, if you see the temperature as **temp=25546**, the real temperature is **25.546 C** (25546/1000) and if you see **accelZ=15**, the real acceleration against the z-axis will be **0.015 m/s<sup>2</sup>** (15/1000).

## iBeacon packet structure

iBeacon is one of the supported advertising packet types. You can find more information about the protocol following the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon).

The PDU Payload, in this case, consists of "AdvA" (that is 6 octets long) and "AdvData" (a field that contains data information) fields. Legacy Bluetooth devices can only support 31 byte-long beacon messages. UUID is 16 byte-long (MikroTik default UID=b2b98de4-c81c-47c2-b14e-791b3e5587ec).

## Device Name

When enabled, the tag will broadcast a short payload which contains configured "Device Name".

| Property | Description | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flags | Flags field's length, type and data. Is used to "tell" surrounding scanners in which state the device is in. | 3 octets (`020106`):  1st octet - length  2nd octet - type  3d octet - data |
| Complette Local Name | part of the advertisement payload, which contains Local Name information. |  Length = 1 octet  AD type = 1 octet  Name bytes = x octets. |

### Device Name PDU Payload structure

If we configure "Device Name" to be "TG-BT5-OUT":

| Octet | Value | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 02 | Flags | length of the flags field |
| 1 | 01 | Flags | type of the flags field |
| 2 | 06 | Flags | data of the flags field |
| 3 | 0b | Length | Length byte |
| 4 | 09 | AD Type | Complete Local Name type byte |
