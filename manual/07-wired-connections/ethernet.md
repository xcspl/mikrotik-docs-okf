# Ethernet

MikroTik RouterOS supports various types of Ethernet interfaces - ranging from 10Mbps to 10Gbps Ethernet over copper twisted pair, 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 25Gbps SFP/SFP+/SFP28 interfaces and 40Gbps, 100Gbps, 200Gbps, 400Gbps QSFP+/QSFP28/QSFP56/QSFP56-DD interfaces. Certain RouterBoard devices are equipped with a combo interface that simultaneously contains two interface types (e.g. Ethernet over twisted pair and SFP/SFP+ interface) allowing selection of the most suitable option or creation of a physical link failover. Through RouterOS, it is possible to control different Ethernet-related properties like link speed, auto-negotiation, duplex mode, etc, monitor transceiver diagnostic information and see a wide range of Ethernet-related statistics.

## Auto-negotiation and Forced Link Mode

Auto-negotiation is a communication method and a set of steps employed by Ethernet devices connected via twisted pair cables. It enables these devices to agree on key transmission settings, including speed, duplex mode, and flow control. During this process, the connected devices initially exchange information about their capabilities concerning these settings. Afterward, they mutually select the best possible transmission mode that both devices can support effectively.

However, in RouterOS auto-negotiation behaves differently on SFP/QSFP ports compared to standard RJ45 Ethernet ports. In the case of SFP/QSFP interfaces, the negotiation process does not involve the exchange of advertised capabilities (no advertisement bits are shared). Instead, RouterOS attempts to bring up the link using the highest supported mode on each side. For a successful connection, both devices must advertise the same highest common mode.

## For example

- Device A advertises `10G-baseCR` and `25G-baseCR`.
- Device B advertises only `10G-baseCR`.

In this case, the link will not establish, because Device A prioritizes 25G while Device B advertises only 10G.

## To ensure a successful link

- Both Device A and Device B must have the same highest advertised mode.  
  So if Device B advertises `25G-baseCR`, and Device A also includes `25G-baseCR` as its highest advertisement, the link will be established.

In summary, when configuring SFP/QSFP interfaces, make sure that the highest supported mode matches on both ends to ensure proper link establishment.

### Advertise

Prior to RouterOS version 7.12, when auto-negotiation was enabled, interfaces attempted to guess the maximum available speed of the interface on the other end (making the advertise setting inapplicable for SFP/QSFP interfaces).

After RouterOS version 7.12, you can now manually set the advertise bits to specify the desired link modes you want to use. The speed arguments have also been revised to provide clearer representation, as the previous values were too ambiguous. Additionally, the full-duplex setting has been removed because the new link modes already encompass the duplex options (see table below).

**Link Mode Naming Scheme**

**Transmission Rates**: The first number followed by 'M' or 'G' (e.g., 10M, 100M, 1G) represents the data transmission rates in megabits or gigabits per second.

**Interface Types**: The symbols after "base" indicate the interface types:

- **T**: Stands for twisted pair cabling, followed by the duplex mode (either half or full).
- **SR-LR**: Stands for "short-range" and "long-range" optical modules, including other variants like LRM, ER, ZR, etc. These link modes should be used with optical modules.
- **CR**: Stands for twin-axial copper and is used with direct attach cable (DAC). For 1Gbps DAC, the appropriate link mode is 1G-baseX.
- **FX:** Stands for Fast Ethernet over Fiber optic cable. This also includes LX - long-wavelength standard.

**Number of Lines**:

- **SR2-LR2/CR2**: means two lines.
- **SR4-LR4/CR4**: means four lines.
- **SR8-LR8/CR8:** means eight lines.

:::

Before manually configuring the advertise bits for your interface, first determine which bits are supported by executing the command `/interface/ethernet/monitor` and checking the "supported" list. You can also view the advertise bits supported by your transceiver under the "sfp-supported" field. Additionally, the "advertising" will show the bits that RouterOS has automatically set. The list is generated by comparing the maximum available link mode values on your interface and transceiver and selecting the ones that match.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/ethernet/monitor qsfp28-1-1
                      name: qsfp28-1-1
                 supported: 10M-baseT-half,10M-baseT-full,100M-baseT-half,100M-baseT-full,1G-baseT-half,1G-baseT-full,
                            1G-baseX,2.5G-baseT,2.5G-baseX,5G-baseT,10G-baseT,10G-baseSR-LR,10G-baseCR,40G-baseSR4-LR4,
                            40G-baseCR4,25G-baseSR-LR,25G-baseCR,50G-baseSR2-LR2,50G-baseCR2,100G-baseSR4-LR4,100G-baseCR4
             sfp-supported: 10G-baseSR-LR,25G-baseSR-LR,100G-baseSR4-LR4
               advertising: 10G-baseSR-LR,25G-baseSR-LR,100G-baseSR4-LR4
... 
```

One application where manually set advertise settings could be used is for all sub-interfaces under QSFP. The overall configuration process starts with the topmost enabled port. If the chosen mode is valid and supported, it will be applied. If that particular link mode requires multiple lanes, the advertise and speed configuration of the next interface is ignored, but the interface should remain **enabled**. The next available free lane or port follows a similar process.

```ros
/interface/ethernet
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-1 ] advertise=50G-baseCR2
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-3 ] advertise=25G-baseCR
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-4 ] advertise=25G-baseCR
```

:::warning
**Note**: Multiple-channel interface link modes (50G-baseCR2, 50G-baseSR2-LR2 ) can not be configured for a single-channel interface (SFP28/SFP56).

IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) capabilities are disabled on all our products. There is no option to manually enable or disable EEE settings.

### Ethernet LED behavior

#### Green LED (Link/Speed)  

- On (solid) – max rate

#### Yellow/Amber LED (Activity/Speed)

- On (solid) - link established.  
- Off – No link.  
- Blinking – Data is being transmitted.

### Forced Mode

In the situation when a warning message appears in the log records after connecting the DAC cable or optical module, as an example:

```ros
10:20:47 interface,warning sfp-sfpplus1 module auto-initialization failed, try forced-mode
```

This may indicate that the connected cable or module has a corrupted or bad EEPROM checksum, which causes the automatic connection configuration to fail. This functionality was introduced in RouterOS version 7.12 and may affect some links that worked in the past by mistake with wrongly assumed module/cable attributes, which could lead to various problems related to link connection and device functionality.

In such cases, you can attempt to set the link mode manually, and this might help establish a working link. The following forced port setting examples are provided:

- For DAC cables and connection speeds of 1G/10G/25G.

```ros
/interface/ethernet
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=1G-baseX
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseCR
```

:::info
Note: When selecting the interface speed setting, pay attention to what rates your DAC cable supports (check cable specification data)
:::

- For optical modules and connection speeds of 1G/10G/25G.

```ros
/interface/ethernet
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=1G-baseX
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
```

:::warning
Note: When selecting the interface speed setting, pay attention to what rates your optical module supports (check module specification data)

Modules with bad EEPROM checksum do not output any EEPROM information to the Ethernet monitor, which will also mean that the SFP DDM monitor does not work for such modules.

### FEC

FEC (Forward Error Correction) is a digital signal processing method that improves the bit error rate of SFP28, QSFP+, and QSFP28 links by adding information (parity bits) to the data at the transmitter side. The receiver side then uses this information to detect and correct errors that may have been introduced during transmission.

To ensure a successful link, the same *fec-mode* should be used on both ends of the link. RouterOS uses a disabled *fec-mode* as the default setting, but it can be changed to *fec74* (also known as FC-FEC) or *fec91* (also known as RS-FEC). For more information on FEC mode options, refer to the [property](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wired-connections/ethernet.md#properties) description. The table below shows link modes and supported FEC modes:

| Link Modes (for advertise and speed properties) | Supported FEC modes |
| :-- | :-- |
| 40G-baseSR4-LR4 | fec74 |
| 40G-baseCR4 | fec74 |
| 25G-baseSR-LR | fec74, fec91\* |
| 25G-baseCR | fec74, fec91\* |
| 50G-baseSR2-LR2 | fec74, fec91 |
| 50G-baseCR2 | fec74, fec91 |
| 100G-baseSR4-LR4 | fec91 |
| 100G-baseCR4 | fec91 |
| 50G-baseSR-LR | fec91 (required) |
| 50G-baseCR | fec91 (required) |
| 100G-baseSR2-LR2 | fec91 (required) |
| 100G-baseCR2 | fec91 (required) |
| 200G-baseSR4-LR4 | fec91 (required) |
| 200G-baseCR4 | fec91 (required) |
| 400G-baseSR8-LR8 | fec91 (required) |
| 400G-baseCR8 | fec91 (required) |

:::warning
**Note**: The CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe device does not support fec91 on SFP28 interfaces.

Advertising higher speeds than the actual interface supported speed can result in undefined behavior. Multiple options are allowed. |
| **arp** (*disabled \| enabled \| local-proxy-arp \| proxy-arp \| reply-only*; Default: **enabled**) | Address Resolution Protocol mode:disabled - the interface will not use ARPenabled - the interface will use ARPlocal-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interfaceproxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfacesreply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originated from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which are entered as static entries in the ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the ARP table. Therefore for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist. |
| **arp-timeout** (*auto \| integer*; Default: **auto**) | How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from IP. Value `auto` equals the value of `arp-timeout` in IP/Settings, default is 30s. |
| **auto-negotiation** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When enabled, the interface "advertises" its maximum capabilities to achieve the best connection possible.Note1: Auto-negotiation should not be disabled on one end only, otherwise Ethernet Interfaces may not work properly.Note2: Gigabit Ethernet and NBASE-T Ethernet links cannot work with auto-negotiation disabled. |
| **bandwidth** (*integer/integer*; Default: **unlimited/unlimited**) | Sets max rx/tx bandwidth in kbps that will be handled by an interface. TX limit is supported on all Atheros [switch-chip](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md) ports. RX limit is supported only on Atheros8327/QCA8337 switch-chip ports. |
| **cable-setting** (*default \| short \| standard*; Default: **default**) | Changes the cable length setting (only applicable to NS DP83815/6 cards) |
| **combo-mode** (*auto \| copper \| sfp*; Default: **auto**) | When auto mode is selected, the port that was first connected will establish the link. In case this link fails, the other port will try to establish a new link. In case of a reboot, any of the two ports can be running, it depends on which port will successfully establish the link first. When sfp mode is selected, the interface will only work through SFP/SFP+ cage. When copper mode is selected, the interface will only work through RJ45 Ethernet port. |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Descriptive name of an item |
| **disable-running-check** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Disable running check. If this value is set to 'no', the router automatically detects whether the NIC is connected with a device in the network or not. The default value is 'yes' because older NICs do not support it. (relevant only to CHR and x86) |
| **fec-mode**(*auto \| fec74 \| fec91 \| off;* Default: **auto**) | Changes Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode for SFP28, QSFP+ and QSFP28 interfaces. The same mode should be used on both link ends, otherwise FEC mismatch could result in non-working link or even false link-ups.  **It is recommended to enable FEC, particularly when creating a link between CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches. Some optical modules might rely on FEC functionality in MACs.** auto - same as offfec74 - enables IEEE 802.3 clause 74 FEC (aka FC-FEC), can be used with 25Gbps, 40Gbps and 50Gbps link modesfec91 - enables IEEE 802.3 clause 91 FEC (aka RS-FEC), can be used with 25Gbps, 50Gbps, 100Gbps, 200Gbps and 400Gbps link modesoff - disables FEC. |
| **tx-flow-control** (*on \| off \| auto*; Default: **off**) | When set to on, the port will generate pause frames to the upstream device to temporarily stop the packet transmission. Pause frames are only generated when some router's output interface is congested and packets cannot be transmitted anymore. **auto** is the same as **on** except when auto-negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what the other end advertises. |
| **rx-flow-control** (*on \| off \| auto*; Default: **off**) | When set to on, the port will process received pause frames and suspend transmission if required. **auto** is the same as **on** except when auto-negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what other end advertises. |
| **full-duplex** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Defines whether the transmission of data appears in two directions simultaneously, only applies when auto-negotiation is disabled. Since RouterOS v7.12, the setting is replaced with new speed link modes. |
| **l2mtu** (*integer [0..65536]*; Default: ) | Layer2 Maximum transmission unit. [Read more](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/hardware/mtu-in-routeros.md). |

| **mdix-enable** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Whether the MDI/X auto cross over cable correction feature is enabled for the port (Hardware specific, e.g. ether1 on RB500 can be set to yes/no. Fixed to 'yes' on other hardware.) |
| **mtu** (*integer [0..65536]*; Default: **1500**) | Layer3 Maximum transmission unit |
| **name** (*string*; Default: ) | Name of an interface |
| **orig-mac-address** (*read-only: MAC*; Default: ) | Original Media Access Control number of an interface. |
| **passthrough-interface** (*interface*; Default: ) | Sets an interface in passthrough mode on the CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe device. By default, the PCIe interface will show up as four virtual Ethernet interfaces. Two interfaces in passthrough mode to the 25G SFP28 cages. The remaining two virtual Ethernet-PCIe interfaces are bridged with the Gigabit Ethernet port for management access. |
| **poe-out** (*auto-on \| forced-on \| off*; Default: **off**) | Poe Out settings. [`Read more`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/hardware/poe-out.mdx). |
| **poe-priority** (*integer [0..99]*; Default: ) | Poe Out settings. [`Read more`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/hardware/poe-out.mdx). |
| **sfp-shutdown-temperature** (*integer*; Default: **95** \| **80**) | The temperature in Celsius at which the interface will be temporarily turned off due to too high detected SFP module temperature (introduced v6.48). The default value for SFP/SFP+/SFP28 interfaces is 95, and for QSFP+/QSFP28 interfaces 80 (introduced v7.6). |
| **sfp-rate-select**(*high \| low*; Default: **high**) | Allows control of the rate select pin for SFP ports. |

## Detect Cable Problems

A cable test can detect problems or measure the approximate cable length if the cable is unplugged on the other end and there is, therefore, "no-link". RouterOS will show:

- which cable pair is damaged
- the distance to the problem
- how exactly the cable is broken - short-circuited or open-circuited

This also works if the other end is simply unplugged - in that case, the total cable length will be shown.

Here is an example output:

```ros
[admin@CCR] > interface ethernet cable-test ether2 
name: ether2 
status: no-link 
cable-pairs: open:4,open:4,open:4,open:4
```

In the above example, the cable is not shorted but “open” at 4 meters distance; all cable pairs are equally faulty at the same distance from the switch chip.

Currently `cable-test` is implemented on the following devices:

| Devices |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| CCR1xxx series | RB952Ui-5ac2nD | RBLHGG-5acD |
| CRS1xx series | RB962UiGS-5HacT2HnT | RB5009 series (eth1) |

:::warning
Currently `cable-test` is not supported on Combo ports.

## Stats

Using the `/interface/ethernet/print stats` command, it is possible to see a wide range of Ethernet-related statistics. The list of statistics can differ between RouterBoard devices due to different Ethernet drivers. The list below contains all available counters across all RouterBoard devices. Most of the Ethernet statistics can be remotely monitored using [SNMP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/snmp.md) and MIKROTIK-MIB.
