# SNMP

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet-standard protocol used to monitor and manage devices on IP networks. It can be used with monitoring tools such as Cacti, MRTG, or The Dude to collect, visualize, and graph system data.

SNMP write access is available only for selected OIDs. For supported OIDs, write operations are available using SNMP v1, v2c, or v3. SNMP replies are sent through the same interface on which the request was received, ensuring that the response uses the same source address as the destination address used in the original request to the router.

:::warning
The SNMP service collects data from various services running on the system. If communication between SNMP and one of these services takes longer than expected, the system may log a warning such as timeout while waiting for program or SNMP did not get OID data within the expected time, ignoring OID. The timeout is 30 seconds per service, or up to 5 minutes for the routing service. After such a timeout, the affected service may temporarily stop responding to SNMP data requests before attempting to retrieve the requested information again.

These warnings do not indicate a problem with the SNMP service itself. In most cases, they occur when SNMP is used to monitor a slow or heavily loaded service. They may also appear when monitoring OIDs that are not suitable for polling through SNMP. In such cases, the recommended solution is to exclude those OIDs from the monitoring tool configuration.

## Quick Configuration

To enable SNMP in RouterOS:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /snmp> print 
enabled: no
contact: 
location: 
engine-id: 
trap-community: (unknown)
trap-version: 1
[admin@MikroTik] /snmp> set enabled yes
```

You can also specify administrative contact information in the above settings. All SNMP data will be available to communities configured in the *community* menu.

## General Properties

**Sub-menu:** `/snmp`

 This sub menu allows enabling SNMP and configuring general settings.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **contact** (*string*; Default: **""**) | Contact information |
| **enabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Used to disable/enable SNMP service |
| **engine-id** (*string*; Default: **""**) | For SNMP v3, used as part of the identifier. You can configure it manually or a random value will be assigned |
| **location** (*string*; Default: **""**) | Location information |
| **trap-community** (*string*; Default: **public**) | Which communities are configured in the *community* menu to use when sending out the trap. |
| **trap-generators** (*interfaces \| start-trap*; Default: ) | What action will generate traps:interfaces - interface changes;start-trap - SNMP server starting on the routertemp-exception - send trap when temperature reached 100c (or value configured for cpu-overtemp-threshold at `/system/health` ) |
| **trap-interfaces** (*string \| all*; Default: ) | List of interfaces that traps are going to be sent out. |
| **trap-target** (*list of IP/IPv6*; Default: **0.0.0.0**) | IP (IPv4 or IPv6) addresses of SNMP data collectors that have to receive the trap |
| **trap-version** (*1\|2\|3*; Default: **1**) | A version of SNMP protocol to use for trap |
| **src-address** (*IPv4 or IPv6 address*; Default: **::**) | Force the router to always use the same IP source address for all of the SNMP messages |
| **vrf** (*VRF name*; default value: **main**) | Set VRF on which the service is listening for incoming connections |

:::note
The engine-id field holds the suffix value of engine-id, usually, SNMP clients should be able to detect the value, as SNMP values, as read from the router. However, there is a possibility that this is not the case. In which case, the engine-ID value has to be set according to this rule: \<engine-id prefix> + \<hex-dump suffix>, so as an example, if you have set 1234 as the suffix value you have to provide 80003a8c04 + 31323334, the combined hex (the result) is 80003a8c0431323334
:::

## Community Properties

**Sub-menu:** `/snmp/community`

This sub-menu allows to set up access rights for the SNMP data.

There is little security in v1 and v2c, just a clear text community string („username“) and the ability to limit access by IP address.

In the production environment, SNMP v3 should be used as it provides security - Authorization (User + Pass) with MD5/SHA1, Encryption with DES and AES.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /snmp/community> print value-list 
name: public
address: 0.0.0.0/0
security: none
read-access: yes
write-access: no
authentication-protocol: MD5
encryption-protocol: DES
authentication-password: *****
encryption-password: *****
```

:::danger
Default settings only have one community named *public* without any additional security settings. These settings should be considered insecure and should be adjusted according to the required security profile.
:::

## Management information base (MIB)

The Management Information Base (MIB) is the database of information maintained by the agent that the manager can query. You can download the latest MikroTik RouterOS MIB file from here: [https://mikrotik.com/download/tools](https://mikrotik.com/download/tools)

Used MIBs in RouterOS:

- MIKROTIK-MIB
- MIB-2
- HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
- IF-MIB
- IP-MIB
- IP-FORWARD-MIB
- IPV6-MIB
- BRIDGE-MIB
- DHCP-SERVER-MIB
- CISCO-AAA-SESSION-MIB
- ENTITY-MIB
- UPS-MIB
- SQUID-MIB

## Object identifiers (OID)

Each OID identifies a variable that can be read via SNMP. Although the MIB file contains all the needed OID values, you can also print individual OID information in the console with the **print oid** command at any menu level:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface> print oid

Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, R - running, S - slave 
0 R name=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1 mtu=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4.1 
mac-address=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.1 admin-status=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7.1 
oper-status=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.1 bytes-in=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.1 
packets-in=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11.1 discards-in=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13.1 
errors-in=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.1 bytes-out=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.1 
packets-out=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17.1 discards-out=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19.1 
errors-out=.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20.1 
```

## Traps

SNMP traps enable the router to notify the data collector of interface changes and SNMP service status changes by sending traps. It is possible to send out traps with security features to support SNMPv1 (no security). SNMPv2, variants, and SNMPv3 with encryption and authorization.

For SNMPv2 and v3 you have to set up an appropriately configured community as a *trap-community* to enable required features (password or encryption/authorization).

## SNMP write

SNMP write allows changing router configuration with SNMP requests. Consider securing access to the router or to the router's SNMP, when SNMP and write-access are enabled.

To change settings by SNMP requests, use the command below to allow SNMP to write for the selected community.

```ros
/snmp/community/set <number> write-access=yes
```

### System Identity

It's possible to change the router system identity by an SNMP set command.

```bash
snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s New_Identity
```

- *snmpset* - SNMP application used for SNMP SET requests to set information on a network entity;
- *public* - router's community name;
- *192.168.88.1* - IP address of the router;
- *1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0* - SNMP value for router's identity;

The SNMPset command above is equal to the RouterOS command:

```ros
/system/identity/set identity=New_Identity
```

### Reboot

It's possible to reboot the router with an SNMP set command. You need to set the value for reboot SNMP settings, which is not equal to 0.

```bash
snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.7.1.0 s 1
```

- **1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.7.1.0**, SNMP value for the router reboot.
- **s 1**, snmpset command to set value, the value should not be equal to 0.

The Reboot SNMPset command is equal to the RouterOS command:

```ros
/system/reboot
```

### Run Script

SNMP write allows running scripts on the router from the **system script** menu when you need to set a value for the SNMP setting of the script.

```bash
snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.X s 1
```

- **X**, script number, numeration starts from 1.
- **s 1**, snmpset command to set a value, the value should not be equal to 0.

The same command on RouterOS:

```ros
/system/script> print 
Flags: I - invalid 
0 name="test" owner="admin" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,
test,winbox,password,sniff last-started=1970-01-01
01:31:57 run-count=23 source=:beep 

/system/script/run 0
```

:::danger
SNMP is limited to *ftp,reboot,**read,write,test,romon* script policies. If the script has greater policies than  *ftp,reboot,**read,write,test,romon* - then the script will not be executed. Make sure your scripts do not exceed the mentioned policies.
:::

### Running scripts with GET

It is possible to run `/system/scripts` via SNMP GET request of the script OID (since 6.37). For this to work, an SNMP community with write permission is required. OIDs for scripts can be retrieved via the SNMPWALK command as the table is dynamic.

#### Add script

```ros
/system/script
add name=script1 owner=admin policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="/sy reboot "
add name=script2 owner=admin policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="[:put output]"
```

#### Get the script OID table

```bash
$ snmpwalk -v2c -cpublic 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.2.1 = STRING: "script1"
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.2.2 = STRING: "script2"
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.1 = INTEGER: 0
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.2 = INTEGER: 0
```

#### To run the script use table 18

```bash
$ snmpget -v2c -cpublic 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.18.1.1.2.2
iso.3.6	.1.4.1.14988.1.1.18.1.1.2.2 = STRING: "output"
```

:::danger
SNMP is limited to *ftp,reboot,**read,write,test,romon* script policies. If the script has greater policies than  *ftp,reboot,**read,write,test,romon* - then the script will not be executed. Make sure your scripts do not exceed the mentioned policies.
