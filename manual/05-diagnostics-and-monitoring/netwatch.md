# Netwatch

[*Netwatch CLI References*](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/netwatch)

Netwatch monitors the state of hosts on the network. Monitoring can be done with the following probe types:  
1) [**Simple**](#simple-probe) - Uses ping, without the use of advanced metrics  
2) [**ICMP**](#icmp-probe) - Pings to a specified IP address - hosts, with an option to adjust threshold values
3) [**TCP-conn**](#tcp-conn-probe) - Tests the TCP connection  
4) [**HTTP-GET**](#http-get-probe) - Sends a request to a server you are monitoring
5) [**HTTPS-GET**](#https-get-probe) - Sends a request to a server you are monitoring
6) [**DNS**](#dns-probe) - Sends a DNS query to a DNS server and checks for a response.  

## General configuration information

This section covers information that is relevant to all Netwatch probe types.

* Default Netwatch values are always used - **even if they were not defined** by the user. Configurable variables list with default values and read-only/statistics variables can be seen on a [Netwatch CLI-reference page](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/netwatch). Make sure to check the if the default variables are appropriate for your use case.

* For all probe types, the `host` variable is mandatory, as it defines address of the device that should be monitored.

* Netwatch probes can execute scripts depending on probe status changes, allowing RouterOS to dynamically adjust the router configuration or send notifications (*for more information, see the [scripting documentation](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/scripting)*). Netwatch supports three script types, each executed under different conditions:

  * `up-script` is executed when the status changes from **Unknown** (*depending on the `ignore-initial-up` variable; see the [CLI Reference](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/netwatch) for more information*) or **Down** to **Up**;
  * `down-script` is executed when the status changes from **Unknown** (*depending on the `ignore-initial-down` variable; see the [CLI Reference](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/tool/netwatch) for more information*) or **Up** to **Down**;
  * `test-script` is executed during every probe test.

* If no scripts are specified for the probe, it is still possible to observe probe status changes in the log. Probe identification information and status changes are printed to the log when `info` topic [logging](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/log) is enabled. Detailed probe stats and config are printed to `debug` topic level.

* You can view statistics and use these variables in scripting. Keep in mind that variables containing "-" must be written like this, for example, "done-tests" would be $"done-tests"

* Netwatch executes scripts as *sys user, so any defined global variable in the Netwatch script will not be readable by, for example, a [scheduler](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/scheduler) or other users.

* Netwatch is limited to *read,write,test,reboot* [script policies](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/scripting). If the owner of the script does not have enough permissions to execute a certain command in the script, then the script will not be executed. If the script has greater policies than *read,write,test,reboot* - then the script will not be executed as well. Make sure your scripts do not exceed the mentioned policies.

* It is possible to disable permission checking for RouterOS scripts under the *`/system/scripts`* menu ([scripting documentation](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/developer-guides/scripting)). This is useful when Netwatch does not have enough permissions to execute a script, though this decreases overall security. It is recommended to assign proper permissions to a script instead.

* Simple, ICMP, HTTP, and TCP-connect probes are sent with the "don't fragment" flag set. With an ICMP probe, you can set `packet-size`, which in combination with the DF flag, can be used to aid with [path MTU discovery](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/hardware/mtu-in-routeros).

## Simple probe

Periodically sends a simple ICMP ping request to check host availability. Only general probe parameters apply to this probe type.

### Configuration Example

Simple probe configuration that checks Google DNS service, with scripts that log change of the probe status.

```ros
/tool/netwatch/add host=8.8.8.8 up-script=":log info \"Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful\"" down-script=":log info \"Ping to 8.8.8.8 failed\""
```

In this example, a simple probe is configured to check whether 8.8.8.8 is reachable by ping. When the probe status changes, a log entry is created depending on the type of status change.

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_01_simple_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_01_simple_probe_example.webp)

In the logging section, you can see that Netwatch executed the script. The example below shows `up-script` execution and the Netwatch status change. In this case, logging for the `info` topic must be enabled for these log entries to appear.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /log/print where message~"8.8.8.8"
 2026-06-10 14:48:17 netwatch,info event up [ type: simple, host: 8.8.8.8 ]
 2026-06-10 14:48:17 script,info Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful
```

## ICMP probe

A more advanced version of the `simple` probe type that also uses ICMP packets to check the state of the host. Compared to the `simple` probe type, `ICMP` allows more complex threshold configuration and can send multiple ICMP ping packets instead of only one.

### Configuration Example

This example shows how to use `ICMP` probe thresholds, this example uses `thr-avg` threshold to monitor average round trip time to the server.

```ros
/tool/netwatch/add host=8.8.8.8 type=icmp thr-avg=10ms up-script=":log info \"rtt average is \$\"rtt-avg\", threshold passed, ping to 8\
    .8.8.8 successful\"" down-script=":if (\$\"loss-percent\" < 85) do={ :log info \"rtt average i\
    s \$\"rtt-avg\", which is higher then threshold, please check connection\" } else={ :\
    log info \"Ping to 8.8.8.8 failed\"}"
```

The probe checks whether 8.8.8.8 is reachable by ping and additionally verifies that the `rtt-avg` value is less than 10 ms. Both `up-script` and `down-script` log the `rtt-avg` value upon execution, except when `down-script` is triggered by packet loss of 85% or higher. This distinguishes between probe failures caused by packet loss and failures caused by the configured threshold not being met.

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_02_ICMP_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_02_ICMP_probe_example.webp)

The example below shows `up-script` execution and the Netwatch status change. As shown, the average RTT value is passed as a raw value in microseconds, so make sure to take this into account when writing Netwatch scripts.

```ros
 2026-06-17 10:31:01 netwatch,info event up [ type: icmp, host: 8.8.8.8 ]
 2026-06-17 10:31:01 script,info rtt average is 7686, threshold passed, ping to 8.8.8.8 successful
```

## TCP-conn probe

The `tcp-conn` probe type checks whether the router can establish a TCP connection to a host on a specific TCP port. This allows monitoring of a specific service on the device instead of general device availability through ICMP.

### Configuration Example

This example uses the `tcp-conn` probe type to check if 8.8.8.8 has its DNS port operational.

```ros
/tool/netwatch/add host=8.8.8.8 type=tcp-conn port=53 up-script=":log info \"TCP handshake to 8.8.8.8:53 successful\"" down-script=":log info \"TCP handshake to 8.8.8.8:53 failed\""
```

The `tcp-conn` probe specifically checks if TCP port 53 (DNS port) is able to complete TCP handshake with the router.

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_03_TCP_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_03_TCP_probe_example.webp)

## HTTP-GET probe

`http-get` probe performs an HTTP-GET request to a specified host and verifies the returned HTTP status code and response time. Unlike ICMP or TCP probes, it validates application-layer availability, ensuring the web service is actually responding. A probe is considered successful when the response code falls within the configured `http-codes` range and the response time is within configured thresholds. Commonly used for monitoring website or API availability.

### Configuration Example

In this example, the probe tries to get an HTTP response from mikrotik.com at 159.148.172.205 and logs the response code.

 ```ros
 /tool/netwatch/add host=159.148.172.205 type=http-get down-script=":log info \"Probe down, response code: \$\"http-status-code\"\"" up-script=":log info \"Probe up, response code: \$\"http-status-code\"\""
 ```

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_04_httpget_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_04_httpget_probe_example.webp)

In this log example you can see that the probe went down as it did not meet the status code threshold of 100-299 and received code 302, because mikrotik.com tried to redirect the probe to HTTPS.

```ros
 2026-06-19 14:09:26 netwatch,info event down [ type: http_get, host: 159.148.172.205 ]
 2026-06-19 14:09:26 script,info Probe down, response code: 302
```

## HTTPS-GET probe

The `https-get` probe type is identical to the `http-get` probe type, with the only difference being that it uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. For example, this allows the probe to perform additional [TLS/SSL certificate](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates) validation checks.

### Configuration Example

In this example, the probe monitors the `www-ssl` service on the router itself. The `www-ssl` service is used to provide HTTPS access to the router through [WebFig](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/webfig). ([more info](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/services))

```ros
 /tool/netwatch/add host=127.0.0.1 type=https-get down-script=":log info \"HTTPS WebFig is disabled\"" up-script=":log info \"HTTPS WebFig is enabled\""
```

The probe attempts to retrieve an HTTPS response from the router's local address (`127.0.0.1`). For this probe to work correctly, make sure that the `www-ssl` service is configured with a valid [TLS/SSL certificate](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates).

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_05_httpsget_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_05_httpsget_probe_example.webp)

## DNS probe

The `dns` probe type checks whether a specified domain name can be resolved by a DNS server. If the DNS server returns a valid record for the requested domain name, the probe is considered `Up`.

### Configuration Example

In this configuration example, the probe checks for an A record for mikrotik.com using Google's public DNS server.

```ros
 /tool/netwatch/add host=mikrotik.com type=dns dns-server=8.8.8.8 record-type=A down-script=":log info \"No A type record found\"" up-script=":log info \"A type record found: \$ip\""
```

As shown, `host` is set to `mikrotik.com`, `dns-server` is configured as `8.8.8.8` to override the DNS server configured in [`/ip/dns`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/dns), and `record-type` is set to `A` to query IPv4 address records.

Below, you can see the same configuration example shown in the [WinBox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/management-tools/winbox) view instead of CLI.

![netwatch_06_dns_probe_example_winbox](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/diagnostics-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/img/netwatch_06_dns_probe_example.webp)

The example below shows up-script execution and the Netwatch status change.

```ros
 2026-06-29 10:10:55 netwatch,info event up [ type: dns, host: mikrotik.com ]
 2026-06-29 10:10:55 script,info A type record found: 159.148.172.205
```
