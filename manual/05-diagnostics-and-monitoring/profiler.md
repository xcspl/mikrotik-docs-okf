# Profiler

The profiler tool shows CPU usage for each process running in RouterOS. It helps to identify which process is using most of the CPU resources.  
Watch our [video about this feature](https://youtu.be/BkRaW14p8_s).

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/profile
```

On multi-core systems, the tool allows specifying per core CPU usage.

The "CPU" parameter allows specifying an integer number which represents a core or one of two predefined values **all** and **total:**

- total - this value is set to show the sum of all core usages.
- all - value is set to show CPU usages separately for every available core.

In the following example we will take a look at both predefined values:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/profile cpu=all 
NAME             CPU        USAGE       
ethernet         1          0%          
kvm              0          0%          
kvm              1          4.5%        
management       0          0%          
management       1          0.5%        
idle             0          100%        
idle             1          93%         
profiling        0          0%          
profiling        1          2%    

[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/profile cpu=total 
NAME             CPU        USAGE       
ethernet         all        0%          
console          all        0%          
kvm              all        2.7%        
management       all        0%          
idle             all        97.2%       
profiling        all        0%          
bridging         all        0%  
```
