# Routing Protocol Multi-core Support

RouterOS v7 can split tasks between multiple processes.

One "**main**" task starts and stops sub‑tasks and processes data between them. Each sub‑task can allocate "private" memory (accessible only to that task) and "shared" memory (accessible by all route tasks).

The following tasks run in separate processes when multiprocess routing is enabled:

- FIB update.
- Routing Policy configuration.
- Configuration and reporting - handling of the static route configuration, "route print" command, SNMP monitoring, etc.
- BFD protocol handling
- OSPF protocol handling.
- RIP protocol handling.
- ISIS protocol handling.
- EVPN handling.
- PIM-SM.
- LDP protocol handling.
- Fantasy - handles generation of dummy routing entries for testing purposes.
- BGP connection and configuration handling.
- BGP receive (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters).
- BGP send (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters).

## BGP Sub-Tasks

BGP receive and send can be split into sub‑tasks by specific parameters. For example, you can run input per peer or group all peer inputs and run them in the main process. You control this split with the [`input.affinity`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/routing/bgp/connection.md#input.affinity) and [`output.affinity`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/routing/bgp/connection.md#output.affinity) parameters in [`/routing/bgp/template`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/routing/bgp/template.md). On devices with few cores, adjusting affinity values can boost performance because sharing data between tasks is slightly slower than processing the same data within a single task. For example, on single-core or dual-core devices, running input and output in the main or instance process improves performance.

:::warning
BGP can spawn up to 100 unique processes.
:::

You can monitor all currently used tasks and their allocated private/shared memory with the [`/routing/stats/process/print`](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/routing/stats/process/process.md) command.

## Routing Table Update Mechanism

The following illustration explains, in a more user‑friendly way, how the routing table update mechanism works.

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/img/37224450.png)

Routing protocols continuously loop through the following procedures:

- The "**main**" process waits for updates from other sub‑tasks (1).
- "**main**" starts calculating new routes (2–4) if:
  - an update from a sub‑task is received;
  - the protocol has not published all routes;
  - the configuration or link state has changed.
- During new route calculation (5), the following events occur:
  - all received updates are applied to the route;
  - gateway reachability is determined;
  - recursive routes are resolved;
- The "**publish**" event runs, publishing "**current**" routes. During this phase, "**current**" routes do not change, but protocols can still receive and send updates (6).
- Perform cleanup and free unused memory (7). At this step, anything no longer used in the new "**current**" table is removed (routes, attributes, etc.).

Consider "**updated**" and "**current**" as two copies of the routing table. The "**current**" table (2) is used at the moment, while "**updated**" (1) is the table of candidate routes to be published in the next publish event (3 and 4). This method prevents protocols from filling memory with buffered updates while the "**main**" process performs "**publish**". Instead, protocols send the newest updates directly to the main process, which then copies the new updates into the "**updated**" table. OSPF is slightly more complicated: it internally has a similar process to select current OSPF routes, which are then sent to the "**main**" for further processing.
