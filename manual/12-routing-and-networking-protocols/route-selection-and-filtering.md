# Route Selection and Filtering

## Route Filtering

### Filter Syntax

Routing filter rules use script-like syntax. The following example matches prefixes from subnet 192.168.1.0/24 with a prefix length greater than 24 and increments the default distance by 1. If there is no match, it subtracts the default distance by one.

```ros
/routing/filter/rule
  add chain=myChain \
  rule="if (dst in 192.168.1.0/24 && dst-len>24) {set distance +1; accept} else {set distance -1; accept}"
```

A filter rule may consist of multiple matchers and actions:

```text
if ( [matchers] ) { [actions] } else { [actions] }
```

There are two types of properties:

- Only readable — properties whose values are read-only and cannot be rewritten. They can be used only by matchers.
- Readable/writable — properties whose values are readable and writable. They can be used by filter actions and by matchers.

For numeric properties only, readable properties can be matched by other readable properties or by constant values with boolean operators.

```text
[matchers]:
[prop readable] [bool operator] [prop readable]

[actions]:
[action] [prop writeable] [value]
```

You do not need a boolean operator if the matcher has only one possible operation.

Example without a boolean operator:

```text
if ( protocol connected ) { accept }
```

Example with boolean operator:

```text
if ( bgp-med < 30 ) { accept }
```

With readable flag properties, the matcher does not require a boolean operator or a value.

```text
if ( ospf-dn ) { reject }
```

:::info
The default action of the routing filter chain is `reject`.

| `bgp-path-peer-prepend` |  | Prepend last received remote peer's ASN. If the prefix is originated from the router, then this parameter will not do anything on the router's output, because ASN does not exist yet.    If used as a matcher in BGP input, it is possible to filter prefixes exceeding a certain number of prepends. For example, if a remote peer prepends its ASN 5 times, but we want to allow max 4 times prepended ASN, then we can use: `if (bgp-path-peer-prepend > 4) {reject}`    This parameter also overrides any prepends received from the remote peer, for example, if the remote peer prepended its AS 3 times, we can remove this prepend by setting `bgp-path-peer-prepend 1` in BGP input |

For example, `set bgp-ext-communities rt:1111:2.3.4.5;` It is possible to set/match RAW extended community value in 64-bit hex, for example, `set bgp-ext-communities 0x.........;` |
| `bgp-large-communities` | `inline_large_community_set \| large_community_list_name` | BGP Large Communities attribute is defined in [RFC 8092](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8092).

| Command | Params | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `accept` |  | accept matched prefix and stop processing the chain. |
| `reject` |  | reject matched prefix and stop processing the chain, the prefix will be stored in the memory as "filtered" and will not be a candidate to be selected as the best path. |
| `return` |  | return to the parent chain |
| `jump` | `jump chain_name` | jump to a specified chain |
| `unset` | `unset prop_name` | used to unset the value of the following properties: `pref-src, bgp-med, bgp-out-med, bgp-local-pref` |

#### Operators

##### Matcher Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `&&` | Logical AND operator | `if (dst in 192.168.0.0/16 && dst-len in 16-32) {reject;}` |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR operator | `if (dst in 192.168.0.0/16 \|\| dst-len in 16-32) {reject;}` |
| `not` | Logical NOT operator | `if (not bgp-network) {reject; }` |

##### Num Prop Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `in` | returns true if the value is in the provided numeric range. Numeric range can be written in the following formats: `{int..int}`, `{int-int}` |
| `==` | returns true if numeric values are equal |
| `!=` | returns true if numeric values are not equal |
| `>` | returns true if the left numeric value is greater than the right numeric value |
| `<` | returns true if the left numeric value is less than the right numeric value |
| `>=` | returns true if the left numeric value is greater than or equal to the right numeric value |
| `<=` | returns true if the left numeric value is less than or equal to the right numeric value |

##### Prefix Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `in` | Returns true if the prefix is the subnet of the provided network. If an operator is used to match prefixes from the address list (e.g `dst in list_name`), then it will match only the exact prefix. |
| `!=` | Returns true if the prefix is not equal to the provided value |
| `==` | Returns true if the prefix is equal to the provided value |

:::info
Address lists by design are matching host addresses which means that it will match also  /32 prefix that belongs to any range from the address list. The workaround to exclude /32  prefixes from being advertised is to use dst-len `if (dst in list_name && dst-len < 32) {}`
:::

##### BGP Community Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `equal` | returns true if the provided communities are equal to the route's property value |  |
| `equal-list` | returns true if communities from the provided `community-list` are equal to the route's property value |  |
| `any` | returns true if the route's property value contains at least one of the provided communities |  |
| `any-list` | returns true if the route's property value contains at least one community from the provided list |  |
| `includes` | returns true if the route's property value includes specified communities |  |
| `includes-list` | returns true if the route's property value includes all communities from the specified `communities-list` |  |
| `subset` | returns true if the route's community subset matches communities from the list | `1:1,3:3` will match `1:1,2:2,3:3` |
| `subset-list` | the same as `subset`, but matches communities from the community list. |  |
| `any-regexp` | the same as `any`, but matched by regexp |  |
| `subset-regexp` | the same as `subset`, but matched by regexp |  |

##### String Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `find` | Check if the provided substring is part of the property value |
| `regexp` | Match the string regexp of the property value |

### Deleting BGP Communities

Routing filters allow clearing BGP communities by using the `delete` command. The `delete` command accepts several parameters based on the type of community:

- **communities**:
  - `wk` - Will match and remove well-known communities.
  - `other` - Will match and remove other communities that are not well known.
  - `regexp` - regexp pattern to match communities that should be deleted.
  - `<community-list name>` - Deletes communities from specified `community-list`.
- **ext-communities**:
  - `rt` - Will match and remove **RouteTarget**.
  - `soo` - Will match and remove **Site-of-Origin**.
  - `other` - Will match and remove other ext communities that are not **RT** or **SOO**.
  - `regexp` - regexp pattern to match ext communities that should be deleted.
  - `<community-ext-list name>` - Deletes communities from specified `community-ext-list`.
- **large-communities**:
  - `all` - Removes everything.
  - `regexp` - regexp pattern to match large communities that should be deleted.
  - `<community-large-list name>` - Deletes large communities from specified `community-large-list`.

It is possible to specify multiple community types, for example delete all SOOs, other types of ext communities and specific RTs from the community-ext list:

```ros
/routing/filter/community-ext-list
add list=myRTList communities="rt:1.1.1.1:222"
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="delete bgp-ext-communities soo,other,myRTList;"
```

### AS-PATH Regexp Matching

An AS path is the sequence of autonomous system numbers (ASNs). For example, the AS path `123 456 789` means the route originated from AS 789 and traversed AS 456 before reaching the destination. To apply routing policies, match specific AS numbers or sets of AS numbers in the AS path by using a regular expression (regexp).

There are two common ways to work with AS path data:

- Convert the whole AS path to a string and let regexp operate on the string (ROS v6 or Cisco style).
- Let regexp operate on each AS path entry as a number (ROS v7, Juniper style).

The first method matches per character. The second method matches per AS number. The second method is faster and uses fewer resources than the string matching approach.

This change requires administrators to use new regexp strategies. Old regexp patterns from RouterOS v6 cannot be copied and pasted directly because they can cause syntax errors or unexpected results.

Take this basic AS path filter rule:

```ros
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="if (bgp-as-path .1234.) {accept}"
```

This regexp pattern matches ASN 1234 anywhere in the middle of the AS path. With old style string matching method, the same pattern matches any AS path that contains an ASN with at least six characters and the substring `1234`. An equivalent old style pattern is `._1234_.`.

For example, the old string style pattern `1234[5-9]` matches 12345 through 12349 anywhere in the string. That yields matches such as `12345 3434` and `11 9123467 22`. With new style matcher, the same pattern matches an AS path containing the exact ASN 1234 followed by an ASN from 5 to 9, such as `1234 7 111` or `111 1234 5 222`. It does not match `12345 3434`.

:::danger
Copying regexp patterns between implementations can produce unexpected or dangerous results.

Do not copy Regex patterns directly from ROS v6 or Cisco configurations, they are not directly compatible. It can lead to unexpected or even dangerous configurations in some scenarios.
:::

:::info
The AS-Path parameter must exist for the regexp matcher to be applied. This means that it is not possible to match a non-existent (empty) AS-Path with a regular expression, aka `^$`. `bgp-path-len` should be used instead.
:::

#### Regex Testing Tool

RouterOS has a built-in regexp checking tool to help administrators validate regexps. This tool also supports num-list values so you can test a regexp against any AS path before applying it to routing filters.

```ros
/routing/filter/num-list/add list=test range=100-1500

/routing/filter/test-as-path-regexp regexp="[[:test:]]5678\$" as-path="1234,5678"
```

#### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | Example Explained | Example Matches |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `^` | Represents the beginning of the path | `^1234` | will match an AS-path starting with ASN 1234 |  |
| `$` | Represents the end of the path | `1234$` | will match the AS-path of origin ASN 1234 |  |
| `*` | Zero or more occurrences of the listed ASN | `^1234*$` | will match a Null as-path or an as-path where ASN 1234 may or may not appear multiple times | **Match:**  1234  1234 1234 1234  Null path  **No Match:**  1234 5678 |
| `+` | One or more occurrences of the listed ASN | `1234+` | will match an AS-path where ASN 1234 appears at least once | **Match:**  1234  3 1234 6  **No match:**  12345 678 |
| `?` | Zero or one occurrence of the listed ASN | `^1234? 5678` | will match an AS-path that may or may not start with ASN 1234 appearing once. | **Match**:  5678  1234 5678  **No match:**  1234 1234 5678  12345 5678 |
| `.` | One occurrence of any ASN | `^.$` | will match any AS-path with the length of one. | **Match:**  12345  45678  **No match:**  1234 5678 |
|  `\|`  | Match one of two ASNs on each side | `^(1234\|5678)` | will match an AS-path starting with ASN 1234 or 5678 | **Match**:  1234  5678  1234 5678  **No Match:**  91011 |
| `[ ]`  `[^ ]` | Represents the set of AS numbers where one AS number from the list must match.  Use ^ after opening the bracket to negate the set.  It is also possible to reference the pre-defined num-lists from [num-list](#community-and-num-lists) with [[:numset\_name:]] | `^[1234 5678 1-100]` | will match the AS-path that starts with 1234 or 5678 or from the range of 1 to 100 | **Match:**  1234  99  5678  **No Match:**  101 |
| `()` | Group of regexp terms to match | `^(1234$\|5678)` | will match an AS-path that starts and ends with 1234 or an AS-path that starts with 5678 | **Match:**  1234  5678 9999  **No Match:**  1234 5678 |

:::warning
Repetition ranges {} are not supported.
:::

### Community and Num Lists

A list of commonly used numbers can be configured from the `/routing/filter/num-list` menu. These lists of numbers can be used in the filter rules to simplify the filter setup process.

In a similar manner, you are allowed to also define community, extended community, and large community lists. Community sets can be used for matching, appending, and setting.

For example, match communities from the list and clear the attribute:

```ros
/routing/filter/community-list
add communities=111:222 list=myCommunityList

/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="if (bgp-communities equal-list myCommunityList) {delete bgp-communities wk,other; accept;}"
```

## Route Selection

Route selection rules control how output routes are selected from available candidate routes. By default, if no selection rules are set, output selects the best route.

The following routing table shows two candidate routes and one best route. By default, when BGP selects a route to send out, it chooses the active route.

```text
[admin@4] /routing/route> print where dst-address=1.0.0.0/24
Flags: A - ACTIVE; b, y - COPY
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, AFI, DISTANCE, SCOPE, TARGET-SCOPE, IMMEDIATE-GW
   DST-ADDRESS  GATEWAY         AFI  DISTANCE  SCOPE  TARGET-SCOPE  IMMEDIATE-GW
 b 1.0.0.0/24   10.155.101.217  ip4        19     40            30  10.155.109.254%ether1
Ab 1.0.0.0/24   10.155.101.232  ip4        20     40            30  10.155.109.254%ether1
 b 1.0.0.0/24   10.155.101.231  ip4        20     40            30  10.155.109.254%ether1
```

If you need a preference for routes that are not active, use selection rules.

Selection rules in RouterOS are configured from the `/routing/filter/select-rule` menu.

Select rules can also call routing filters so routes are selected by filter rules. For example, to mimic the default output selection, use this rule set:

```ros
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=get_active rule="if (active) {accept}"

/routing/filter/select-rule
add chain=my_select_chain do-where=get_active
```

Select rules can be also used to limit how many additional paths to pick for BGP Add-path, for example max 3 paths:

```ros
/routing/filter/select-rule add chain=select-for-addpath do-take=3
```

## Routing Filter Wizard

Because writing filter rules in script-like syntax is more complex, routing filter wizard that generates filter rules with ROSv6-like syntax was introduced.

Quick demonstration:

```routeros
[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /routing/filter> filter-wizard <tab>
action        dst                   ospf-type         scope-target      set-gw-check                use-te-nexthop
afi           dst-len               protocol          set-bgp-...       set-scope
bgp-...       gateway               routing-table     set-blackhole     set-scope-target
blackhole     jump-target-chain     rpki              set-comment       set-suppress-hw-offload
chain         match-chain           rpki-verify       set-distance      set-use-te-nexthop
distance      ospf-metric           scope             set-gateway       suppress-hw-offload

[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /routing/filter> filter-wizard action=accept chain=vpn-in afi=vpnv4 set-bgp-ext-communities=rt:2:2
  result: Filter rule 'if (afi vpnv4) { set bgp-ext-communities rt:2:2; accept; }' added

[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /routing/filter> /routing/filter/rule/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive
 0   ;;; added by filter-wizard
     chain=vpn-in rule="if (afi vpnv4) { set bgp-ext-communities rt:2:2; accept; }"
```

The filter wizard adds rules at the end of the list and gives them the comment `added by filter-wizard`.

Errors returned when you try to add a filter with unacceptable values are printed in the CLI and logged in the system log with the `route,error` topic.

```routeros
[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /routing/filter> filter-wizard action=accept chain=vpn-in afi=vpnv4 match-chain=vpn-in
  result: Error adding 'if (chain vpn-in && afi vpnv4) { accept; }'match with 'vpn-in' creates chain loop (6)

[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /routing/filter> /log/print
 2025-05-19 13:05:15 route,error Error adding 'if (chain vpn-in && afi vpnv4) { accept; }'match with 'vpn-in' creates chain loop (6)

```
