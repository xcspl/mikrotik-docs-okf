MPLS stands for MultiProtocol Label Switching. Instead of using IP routing, MPLS bases the packet forwarding decision (outgoing interface and next-hop router) on labels attached to a packet, rather than on fields in the IP header (such as destination address) and the routing table. This approach speeds up the forwarding process because the next-hop lookup is simpler than routing lookup (finding the longest matching prefix).

The efficiency of the forwarding process is the main benefit of MPLS. However, keep in mind that MPLS forwarding disables the processing of network layer (for example, IP) headers. Therefore, you cannot apply network layer-based actions like NAT and filtering to MPLS forwarded packets. Apply any network-layer-based actions at the ingress or egress of the MPLS cloud, with ingress being the preferred method. This way, traffic that you intend to drop does not travel through the MPLS backbone.

MPLS operates by distributing labels with the LDP protocol for active routes, and a labeled packet takes the same path as an unlabeled packet would. When a router routes unlabeled packets along a route for which it has received a label from the next hop, it imposes a label on the packet and sends it to the next hop, where MPLS switches it further along the path. When a router receives a packet with a label it has assigned to a particular route, it replaces the packet label with the one received from the next hop of that route and sends the packet to the next hop. A label switched path ensures delivery of data to the MPLS cloud egress point. MPLS applications are based on this concept of label switched paths.

Another way to establish label switching paths is through traffic engineering tunnels (TE tunnels) using the RSVP-TE protocol. Traffic engineering tunnels allow explicitly routed LSPs and constraint-based path selection (where constraints are interface properties and available bandwidth).

Because MPLS introduces complexity and new protocols, and adds different concepts to routed and bridged networks, you should develop an in-depth understanding of MPLS concepts before implementing MPLS in a production network. Some suggested reading material:
