# CAPsMAN

:::info
This is the legacy CAPsMAN (`/caps-man`), used by devices running the `wireless` package (`/interface/wireless`). For devices running the `wifi-qcom` or `wifi-qcom-ac` packages (the `/interface/wifi` menu), see [WiFi CAPsMAN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/wifi/capsman.md) instead. The two are separate: a WiFi CAP can only join a WiFi CAPsMAN, and a legacy CAP can only join a legacy CAPsMAN.
:::

This section covers CAPsMAN wireless controller documentation. Use it to configure centralized access point management for supported RouterOS wireless devices.

## CAPsMAN AAA

Settings to configure CAPsMAN AAA functionality are found in the `/caps-man/aaa` menu:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mac-format** (*string*; Default: **XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX**) | Controls how the MAC address of the client is encoded by Access Point in the User-Name attribute of the MAC authentication and MAC accounting RADIUS requests. |
| **mac-mode** (*as-username \| as-username-and-password*; Default: **as-username**) | By default, the Access Point uses an empty password, when sending Access-Request during MAC authentication. When this property is set to as-username-and-password, Access Point will use the same value for the User-Password attribute as for the User-Name attribute. |
| **mac-caching** (*disabled \| time-interval*; Default: **disabled**) | If this value is set to a time interval, the Access Point will cache RADIUS MAC authentication responses for a specified time, and will not contact the RADIUS server if a matching cache entry already exists. The value disabled will disable the cache. The Access Point will always contact the RADIUS server. |
| **interim-update** (*disabled \| time-interval*; Default: **disabled**) | When RADIUS accounting is used, the Access Point periodically sends accounting information updates to the RADIUS server. This property specifies the default update interval that can be overridden by the RADIUS server using the [Acct-Interim-Interval](#capsman-aaa) attribute. |
| **called-format** (*mac \| mac:ssid \| ssid*; Default: **mac:ssid**) | Format of how the "called-id" identifier will be passed to RADIUS. When configuring radius server clients, you can specify "called-id" in order to separate multiple entries. |

### Example

Assuming that the rest of the settings are already configured and only the "Security" part has been left.

#### Radius authentication with one server

1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration.

2. Configure Radius server client.

3. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself).

```ros
/caps-man/security/add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-encryption=aes-ccm name=radius
/radius/add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless
/caps-man/configuration/set security=radius
```

#### Radius authentication with different radius servers for each SSID

1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration.

2. Configure AAA settings.

3. Configure Radius server clients.

4. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself).

```ros
/caps-man/security/add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-encryption=aes-ccm name=radius 
/caps-man/aaa/set called-format=ssid 
/radius/add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID1 
/radius/add address=y.y.y.y secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID2 
/caps-man/configuration/set security=radius
```

Now everyone connecting to CAPs with ssid=**SSID1** will have their radius authentication requests sent to **x.x.x.x** and everyone connecting to CAPs with ssid=**SSID2** will have their radius authentication requests sent to **y.y.y.y**

## CAPsMAN Access-list

Access list on CAPsMAN is an ordered list of rules that are used to allow/deny clients to connect to any CAP under CAPsMAN control. When a client attempts to connect to a CAP that is controlled by CAPsMAN, CAP forwards that request to CAPsMAN. As a part of the registration process, CAPsMAN consults an access list to determine if a client should be allowed to connect. The default behavior of the access list is to allow a connection.

Access list rules are processed one by one until a matching rule is found. Then the action in the matching rule is executed. If the action specifies that the client should be accepted, the client is accepted, potentially overriding its default connection parameters with ones specified in the access-list rule.

An access list is configured in the `/caps-man/access-list` menu. There are the following parameters for access-list rules:

- Client matching parameters:
  - address - MAC address of the client.
  - mask - MAC address mask to apply when comparing client address.
  - interface - optional interface to compare with an interface to which the client actually connects.
  - time - a time of day and days when rule matches.
  - signal-range - range in which client signal must fit for a rule to match.
  - allow-signal-out-of-range - an option that permits the client's signal to be out of the range always or for some time interval.
- Action parameter - specifies an action to take when client matches:
  - accept - accept the client.
  - reject - reject the client.
  - query-radius - query RADIUS server if a particular client is allowed to connect.
- Connection parameters:
  - ap-tx-limit - tx speed limit in the direction to the client.
  - client-tx-limit - tx speed limit in the direction to the AP (applies to RouterOS clients only).
  - client-to-client-forwarding - specifies whether to allow forwarding data received from this client to other clients connected to the same interface.
  - private-passphrase - *[sensitive](https://manual.mikrotik.com/getting-started/configuration-management/list-of-menus-with-sensitive-parameters.md)* PSK passphrase to use for this client if some PSK authentication algorithm is used.
  - radius-accounting - specifies if RADIUS traffic accounting should be used if RADIUS authentication gets done for this client.
  - vlan-mode - VLAN tagging mode specifies if traffic coming from a client should get tagged (and untagged when going to a client).
  - vlan-id - VLAN ID to use if doing VLAN tagging.

## CAPsMAN channel

## CAPsMAN datapath

Datapath settings control data forwarding related aspects. In CAPsMAN datapath settings are configured in the datapath profile menu `/caps-man/datapath` or directly in a configuration profile or interface menu as settings with the **datapath.** prefix.

There are 2 major forwarding modes:

- Local forwarding mode, where CAP is locally forwarding data to and from the wireless interface.
- Manager forwarding mode, where CAP sends to CAPsMAN all data received over wireless and only sends out the wireless data received from CAPsMAN. In this mode, even client-to-client forwarding is controlled and performed by CAPsMAN.

Forwarding mode is configured on a per-interface basis - so if one CAP provides 2 radio interfaces, one can be configured to operate in local forwarding mode and the other in manager forwarding mode. The same applies to Virtual-AP interfaces - each can have a different forwarding mode from the master interface or other Virtual-AP interfaces.

Most of the datapath settings are used only when in manager forwarding mode, because in local forwarding mode CAPsMAN does not have control over data forwarding.

There are the following datapath settings:

- bridge -- bridge interface to add the interface to, as a bridge port, when enabled.
- bridge-cost -- bridge port cost to use when adding as a bridge port.
- bridge-horizon -- bridge horizon to use when adding as a bridge port.
- client-to-client-forwarding -- controls if client-to-client forwarding between wireless clients connected to the interface should be allowed, in local forwarding mode this function is performed by CAP, otherwise it is performed by CAPsMAN.
- local-forwarding -- controls forwarding mode.
- openflow-switch -- OpenFlow switch to add the interface to, as a port when enabled.
- vlan-id -- VLAN ID to assign to the interface if vlan-mode enables use of VLAN tagging.
- vlan-mode -- VLAN tagging mode specifies if a VLAN tag should be assigned to the interface (causes all received data to get tagged with a VLAN tag and allows the interface to only send out data tagged with the given tag).

## CAPsMAN interface

CAPsMAN interfaces are managed in the `/caps-man/interface` menu:

```ros
[admin@CM] > /caps-man/interface/print 
Flags: M - master, D - dynamic, B - bound, X - disabled, I - inactive, R - running 
# NAME RADIO-MAC MASTER-INTERFACE 
0 M BR cap2 00:0C:42:1B:4E:F5 none 
1 B cap3 00:00:00:00:00:00 cap2
```

## CAPsMAN manager

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **enabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Disable or enable CAPsMAN functionality |
| **certificate** (*auto \| certificate name \| none*; Default: **none**) | Device certificate |
| **ca-certificate** (*auto \| certificate name \| none*; Default: **none**) | Device CA certificate |
| **require-peer-certificate** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Require all connecting CAPs to have a valid certificate |
| **package-path** (*string \|*; Default: ) | Folder location for the RouterOS packages. For example, use "/upgrade" to specify the upgrade folder from the files section. If an empty string is set, CAPsMAN can use built-in RouterOS packages, note that in this case only CAPs with the same architecture as CAPsMAN will be upgraded. |
| **upgrade-policy** (*none \| require-same-version \| suggest-same-version*; Default: **none**) | CAPsMAN can send NPK packages to CAP devices to upgrade them. This circumvents any upgrade channel preferences the CAP device might have and works by simple number comparison. If a newer version is installed on the CAPsMAN, it will send packages and upgrade the devices, no matter the channel. none - do not perform upgraderequire-same-version - CAPsMAN suggests to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will not provision the CAP. (Manual provision is still possible)suggest-same-version - CAPsMAN suggests to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will still be provisioned |

## CAPsMAN provisioning

CAPsMAN distinguishes between CAPs based on a common-name identifier. The identifier is generated based on the following rules:

- If CAP provides a certificate, the identifier is set to the Common Name field in the certificate.
- Otherwise, an identifier is based on Base-MAC provided by CAP in the form: '[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX]'.

When the DTLS connection with CAP is successfully established (which means that the CAP identifier is known and valid), CAPsMAN makes sure there is no stale connection with CAP using the same identifier. Currently connected CAPs are listed in the `/caps-man/remote-cap` menu:

```ros
[admin@CM] /caps-man> remote-cap print 
# ADDRESS IDENT STATE RADIOS
0 00:0C:42:00:C0:32/27044 MT-000C4200C032 Run 1
```

CAPsMAN distinguishes between actual wireless interfaces (radios) based on their built-in MAC address (radio-mac). This implies that it is impossible to manage two radios with the same MAC address on one CAPsMAN. Radios currently managed by CAPsMAN (provided by connected CAPs) are listed in the `/caps-man/radio` menu:

```ros
[admin@CM] /caps-man> radio print 
Flags: L - local, P - provisioned 
# RADIO-MAC INTERFACE REMOTE-AP-IDENT 
0 P 00:03:7F:48:CC:07 cap1 MT-000C4200C032
```

When a CAP connects, CAPsMAN at first tries to bind each CAP radio to a CAPsMAN master interface based on radio-mac. If an appropriate interface is found, the radio gets set up using the master interface configuration and the configuration of slave interfaces that refer to a particular master interface. At this moment, the interfaces (both master and slaves) are considered bound to the radio and the radio is considered provisioned.

If no matching master interface for radio is found, CAPsMAN executes 'provisioning rules'. Provisioning rules are an ordered list of rules that contain settings that specify which radio to match and settings that specify what action to take if a radio matches.

Provisioning rules for matching radios are configured in the `/caps-man/provisioning` menu:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **action** (*create-disabled \| create-enabled \| create-dynamic-enabled \| none*; Default: **none**) | Action to take if rule matches, specified by the following settings:create-disabled - create disabled static interfaces for radio. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to the radio, but the radio will not be operational until the interface is manually enabled;create-enabled - create enabled static interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to the radio and the radio will be operational;create-dynamic-enabled - create enabled dynamic interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to the radio, and the radio will be operational;none - do nothing, leaves radio in the non-provisioned state; |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Short description of the Provisioning rule |

| **radio-mac** (*MAC address*; Default: **00:00:00:00:00:00**) | MAC address of the radio to be matched, empty MAC (00:00:00:00:00:00) means match all MAC addresses |
| **slave-configurations** (*string*; Default: ) | If **action** is set to create interfaces, then a new slave interface for each configuration profile in this list is created. |

:::warning
If no rule matches the radio, then the implicit default rule with action **create-enabled** and no configurations set is executed.

To get the active provisioning matchers:

```ros
[admin@CM] /caps-man/provisioning> print 
Flags: X - disabled 
0 radio-mac=00:00:00:00:00:00 action=create-enabled master-configuration=main-cfg 
slave-configurations=virtual-ap-cfg name-prefix=""
```

For the user's convenience there are commands that allow the re-execution of the provisioning process for some radio or all radios provided by some AP:

```ros
[admin@CM] > /caps-man/radio/provision 0
```

and

```ros
[admin@CM] > /caps-man/remote-cap/provision 0
```

### CAPsMAN rates

[See `/caps-man/configuration`](#capsman-configuration)

### CAPsMAN registration-table

The Registration table contains a list of clients that are connected to radios controlled by CAPsMAN and is available in the `/caps-man/registration-table` menu:

```ros
[admin@CM] /caps-man> registration-table print
# INTERFACE MAC-ADDRESS UPTIME RX-SIGNAL
0 cap1 00:03:7F:48:CC:0B 1h38m9s210ms -36
```

### CAPsMAN remote-cap

[See `/caps-man/provisioning`](#capsman-provisioning)

### CAPsMAN security

Assuming that the rest of the settings are already configured and only the "Security" part has been left.

**Radius authentication with one server**

1. Create a CAPsMAN security configuration.

2. Configure a Radius server client.

3. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself).

```ros
/caps-man/security/add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-encryption=aes-ccm name=radius 
/radius/add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless 
/caps-man/configuration/set security=radius
```

**Radius authentication with different radius servers for each SSID**

1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration.

2. Configure AAA settings.

3. Configure Radius server clients.

4. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself).

```ros
/caps-man/security/add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-encryption=aes-ccm name=radius 
/caps-man/aaa/set called-format=ssid 
/radius/add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID1 
/radius/add address=y.y.y.y secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID2 
/caps-man/configuration/set security=radius
```

Now everyone connecting to CAPs with ssid=**SSID1** will have their radius authentication requests sent to **x.x.x.x** and everyone connecting to CAPs with ssid=**SSID2** will have their radius authentication requests sent to **y.y.y.y**
