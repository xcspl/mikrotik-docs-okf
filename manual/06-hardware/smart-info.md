# S.M.A.R.T. info

[*S.M.A.R.T. info CLI Reference*](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/cli-reference/disk/smart-info)

S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a monitoring system built into modern storage drives. It lets you read diagnostics of the drive: overall health, temperature, use, error counters and, for NVMe drives, the SMART/Health attributes.

:::info
S.M.A.R.T. information requires the [Storage](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/storage/) package.
:::

For any attached storage device that supports S.M.A.R.T., read the diagnostics with the `/disk/smart-info` command:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk/smart-info nvme1
```

```ros
[admin@R2DUTRDS22162XG4S4XS2XQ20DISKS] > disk/smart-info nvme1

## Reading the output

The important values for drive health:

- `SMART overall-health self-assessment test result`  -  the drive reports whether it considers itself healthy. A drive that reports `FAILED` should be replaced.
- `Temperature`  -  the current temperature of the drive. The warning and critical thresholds are listed in the information section.
- `Available Spare`  -  how much spare capacity the drive still has before it cannot remap bad blocks. When it drops to the `Available Spare Threshold`, the drive is close to the end of its life.
- `Percentage Used`  -  the estimated lifetime use of the drive, based on the manufacturer's rated endurance. At 100% the drive has reached its rated lifespan.
- `Unsafe Shutdowns` and `Media and Data Integrity Errors`  -  how often the drive lost power unexpectedly and how many data errors it detected. Repeated unsafe shutdowns increase the risk of corruption.

The output is the same as `smartctl` reports on Linux, so the S.M.A.R.T. documentation of the drive vendor applies.

:::note
Some USB enclosures cannot pass S.M.A.R.T. information through. If the drive is behind such an enclosure, `/disk/smart-info` reports an error even though the drive itself supports S.M.A.R.T.
