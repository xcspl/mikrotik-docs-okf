# LEDs

## Summary

**Sub-menu:** `/system/leds`

RouterOS allows configuring each LED's activity the way that the user wishes. It is possible to configure the LEDs to display wireless strength, blink the LEDs on interface traffic activity, and many other options.

For example, the default led configuration on Groove

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /system/leds> print 
Flags: X - disabled 
# TYPE INTERFACE LEDS 
0 wireless-signal-strength led1 
led2 
led3 
led4 
led5 
1 interface-activity ether1 user-led 

```

:::warning
Not all boards have the necessary hardware capabilities to support this feature.

:::

:::warning
RB Groove uses five LEDs for wireless strength and one for Ethernet activity monitoring.

## LED Settings

Global settings are stored in the LED Settings menu.

**Sub-menu:** `/system/leds/setting`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **all-leds-off** (*after-1h \| after-1min \| immediate \| never*; Default: **never**) | Whether and when all LEDs of a router can be turned off |

The listed devices support turning off their LEDs (LED dark mode); however, some LEDs still cannot be turned off due to the device design factors.

## Examples

### Basic example

LED control via CLI commands for scripting purposes:

```ros
#add led entry with specific type "on" or "off" to leds menu
/system/leds/add leds=led1 type=off
#to control led
/system/leds/set [find where leds="led1"] type=on
or
/system/leds/set [find where leds="led1"] type=off

```

Enable the User ACT LED to show current CAP status on an RB951

```ros
/system/leds
add leds=user-led type=ap-cap
```

### Modem Signal Strength example

The whole modem-signal strength range is [-113..-51] and the modem-signal-threshold increases the weakest signal limit to -91 so the signal range for LED indication is [-91..-51]. That range is divided into equal parts depending on the number of LEDs configured for modem-signal LED trigger. The first LED turns on when the signal is above -91 and the last LED turns on when the signal reaches -51.

```ros
/system/leds
add interface=lte1 leds=led1,led2,led3,led4,led5 modem-signal-treshold=-91 type=modem-signal

```

### Modem Access Technology example

These LED trigger examples turn on LEDs in order of modem technology generation: GSM; 3G; LTE.

- 1 LED: led1 turns on when LTE is active.

```ros
/system/leds/add interface=lte1 leds=led1 type=modem-technology
```

- 2 LEDs: led1 - 3G; led2 - LTE;

```ros
/system/leds
add interface=lte1 leds=led1,led2 type=modem-technology

```

- 3 LEDs: led1 - GSM; led2 - 3G; led3 - LTE

```ros
/system/leds/add interface=lte1 leds=led1,led2,led3 type=modem-technology
```
