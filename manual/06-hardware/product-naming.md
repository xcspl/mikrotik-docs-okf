# Product Naming

## Introduction

MikroTik product naming can appear confusing at first glance, but all product codes follow a logical naming convention. Understanding this naming structure helps users identify key product features and specifications at a glance. This documentation explains the meaning behind each segment of MikroTik product codes and provides examples to help you decode any model number.

### RouterBOARD (short version RB)

`<board name> <board features>-<built-in wireless> <wireless card features>-<connector type>-<enclosure type>`

### Board Name

Currently, there can be three types of board names:

- **3-symbol name**:
  - 1st symbol stands for series (this can either be a number or a letter); New additions: D - Dakota; C - Cypress; S - Chateau; L - Maple; E - Econet; MA - Miami.
  - 2nd digit indicates the number of potential wired interfaces (Ethernet, SFP, SFP+).
  - 3rd digit indicates the number of potential wireless interfaces (built-in and mPCI and mPCIe slots).

- **Word** - Currently used names are: **OmniTIK, Groove, SXT, SEXTANT, Metal, LHG, DynaDish, cAP, wAP, LDF, DISC, mANTBox, QRT, hAP, hEX**. If the board has fundamental changes in hardware (such as a completely different CPU) a revision version will be added at the end.

- **Exceptional naming** - 600, 800, 1000, 1100, 1200, 2011, 3011, 4011 boards are standalone representatives of the series or have more than 9 wired interfaces, so the name was simplified to full hundreds or development year.

### Board Features

Board features appear immediately after the board name, with no spaces or dashes separating them. The exception is when the board name is a word; in this case, board features are separated by a space.

The following features are used, listed in the order they appear:

- **U** – USB port.
- **P** – Power injection with a controller.
- **i** – Single-port power injector without a controller.
- **A** – Additional memory and/or higher license level.
- **H** – More powerful CPU.
- **G** – Gigabit Ethernet (may be combined with U, A, or H; not used with L).
- **L** – Lite edition.
- **D** – Additional storage disk (SSD or M.2).
- **S** – SFP port (legacy usage for SwitchOS devices).
- **e** – PCIe interface extension card.
- **xN** – Number of CPU cores (for example, x2, x16, x36).
- **R** – MiniPCIe slot with both USB and PCIe lines.
- **M** – M.2 slot with both USB and PCIe lines.

### Built-in wireless details

If the board has built-in wireless, then all its features are represented in the following format:

`<band><power_per_chain><protocol><number_of_chains>`

- **band**:
  - **6** - 6GHz.
  - **5** - 5GHz.
  - **2** - 2.4GHz.
