# Switch Chip Features

---

There are several types of switch chips on Routerboards and they have different sets of features.

:::info
Cloud Router Switch (CRS) series devices have highly advanced switch chips built-in. They support a wide variety of features. For MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch (e.g. CRS3xx), see the [Marvell Prestera switch chip features](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/marvell-prestera-switch-chip-features.md) manual. For more details about switch chip capabilities on CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices, check the [CRS1xx/CRS2xx series switches](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/crs1xx-2xx-series-switches-examples) manual.

The command-line configuration is under the switch menu. This menu contains a list of all switch chips present in the system and some sub-menus as well.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/ethernet/switch/print 
Flags: I - invalid 
 #   NAME         TYPE             MIRROR-SOURCE       MIRROR-TARGET       SWITCH-ALL-PORTS
 0   switch1      Atheros-8327     none                none               
 1   switch2      Atheros-8227     none                none               
```

Depending on the switch type there can be different configuration capabilities available.

## Features

---

### Port Switching

To set up port switching on non-CRS series devices, check the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) page.

:::warning
Port switching in RouterOS v6.41 and newer is done using the bridge configuration. Before RouterOS v6.41 port switching was done using the master-port property.
:::

#### Switch All Ports Feature

Ether1 port on RB450G/RB435G/RB850Gx2 devices has a feature that allows it to be removed/added to the default switch group. This setting is available on the `/interface/ethernet/switch` menu. By default ether1 port will be included in the switch group.

![Switch 4](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-01.webp)

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **switch-all-ports** (no*\| yes*; Default: **yes**) | Changes the ether1 switch group only on RB450G/RB435G/RB850Gx2 devices. <code>yes</code> - ether1 is part of the switch and supports switch grouping and all other advanced Atheros8316/Atheros8327 features including extended statistics (<code>`/interface/ethernet/print` stats</code>).<code>no</code> - ether1 is not part of the switch, effectively making it a stand-alone ethernet port, this way increasing its throughput to other ports in bridged and routed mode, but removing the switching possibility on this port. |

### Port Mirroring

Port mirroring lets the switch copy all traffic that is going in and out of one port (`mirror-source`) and send out these copied frames to some other port (`mirror-target`). This feature can be used to easily set up a 'tap' device that receives all traffic that goes in/out of some specific port. Note that `mirror-source` and `mirror-target` ports have to belong to the same switch (see which port belongs to which switch in the `/interface/ethernet` menu). Also, mirror-target can have a special `cpu` value, which means that mirrored packets should be sent out to the switch chips CPU port. Port mirroring happens independently of switching groups that have or have not been set up.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/ethernet/switch`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mirror-source** (*name \| none*; Default: **none**) | Selects a single mirroring source port. Ingress and egress traffic will be sent to the `mirror-target` port. Note that the `mirror-target` port has to belong to the same switch (see which port belongs to which switch in the `/interface/ethernet` menu). |
| **mirror-target** (*name \| none \| cpu*; Default: **none**) | Selects a single mirroring target port. Mirrored packets from `mirror-source` and `mirror` (see the property in the rule and host table) will be sent to the selected port. |
| **mirror-egress-target** (*name \| none*; Default: **none**) | Selects a single mirroring egress target port, only available on **88E6393X**, **88E6191X** and **88E6190** switch chips. Mirrored packets from `mirror-egress` (see the property in the port menu) will be sent to the selected port. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/ethernet/switch/rule`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mirror** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a packet copy to the `mirror-target` port. |
| **mirror-ports** (*name*; Default: ) | Selects multiple mirroring target ports, only available on the **88E6393X** switch chip. Matched packets in the ACL rule will be copied and sent to selected ports. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/ethernet/switch/host`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mirror** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a frame copy to the `mirror-target` port from a frame with a matching MAC destination address (matching destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches) |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/ethernet/switch/port`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mirror-egress** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send egress packet copy to the `mirror-egress-target` port, only available on **88E6393X**, **88E6191X** and **88E6190** switch chips. |
| **mirror-ingress** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send ingress packet copy to the `mirror-ingress-target` port, only available on **88E6393X**, **88E6191X** and **88E6190** switch chips. |
| **mirror-ingress-target** (*name \| none*; Default: **none**) | Selects a single mirroring ingress target port, only available on  **88E6393X**, **88E6191X** and **88E6190** switch chips. Mirrored packets from `mirror-ingress` will be sent to the selected port. |

Port mirroring configuration example:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch
set switch1 mirror-source=ether2 mirror-target=ether3
```

:::danger
If you set mirror-source as an Ethernet port for a device with at least two switch chips and these mirror-source ports are in a single bridge while mirror-target for both switch chips is set to send the packets to the CPU, then this will result in a loop, which can make your device inaccessible.
:::

### Port Settings

Properties under this menu are used to configure VLAN switching and filtering options for switch chips that support a VLAN Table. These properties are only available to switch chips that have VLAN Table support. Check the [Switch Chip Features](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md) table to make sure your device supports such a feature.

:::danger
Ingress traffic is considered as traffic that is being sent **IN** a certain port; this port is sometimes called **ingress port**. Egress traffic is considered as traffic that is being sent **OUT** of a certain port; this port is sometimes called **egress port**. Distinguishing them is very important to properly set up VLAN filtering since some properties apply only to either ingress or egress traffic.
:::

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **vlan-mode** (*check \| disabled \| fallback \| secure*; Default: **disabled**) | Changes the VLAN lookup mechanism against the [VLAN Table](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md#vlan-table) for ingress traffic.<code>disabled</code> - disables checking against the VLAN Table completely for ingress traffic. No traffic is dropped when set on the ingress port.<code>fallback</code> - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and forwards all untagged traffic. If ingress traffic is tagged and the egress port is not found in the VLAN table for the appropriate VLAN ID, then traffic is dropped. If a VLAN ID is not found in the VLAN Table, then traffic is forwarded. Used to allow known VLANs only in specific ports.<code>check</code> - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and drops all untagged traffic. If ingress traffic is tagged and the egress port is not found in the VLAN table for the appropriate VLAN ID, then traffic is dropped.<code>secure</code> - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and drops all untagged traffic. Both ingress and egress ports must be found in the VLAN Table for the appropriate VLAN ID, otherwise, traffic is dropped. |
| **vlan-header** (*add-if-missing \| always-strip \| leave-as-is*; Default: **leave-as-is**) | Sets the action which is performed on the port for egress traffic.<code>add-if-missing</code> - adds a VLAN tag on egress traffic and uses default-vlan-id from the ingress port. Should be used for trunk ports.<code>always-strip</code> - removes a VLAN tag on egress traffic. Should be used for access ports.<code>leave-as-is</code> - does not add or remove a VLAN tag on egress traffic. Should be used for hybrid ports. |
| **default-vlan-id** (*auto \| integer: 0..4095*; Default: **auto**) | Adds a VLAN tag with the specified VLAN ID on all untagged ingress traffic on a port. It should be used with vlan-header set to `always-strip` on a port to configure the port to be the access port. For hybrid ports default-vlan-id is used to tag untagged traffic. If two ports have the same default-vlan-id, then the VLAN tag is not added since the switch chip assumes that traffic is being forwarded between access ports. |

:::warning
On **QCA8337** and **Atheros8327** switch chips, a default `vlan-header=leave-as-is` property should be used. The switch chip will determine which ports are access ports by using the `default-vlan-id` property. The `default-vlan-id` should only be used on access/hybrid ports to specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
:::

### VLAN Table

The VLAN table specifies certain forwarding rules for packets that have a specific 802.1Q tag. Those rules are of higher priority than switch groups configured using the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) feature. Basically, the table contains entries that map specific VLAN tag IDs to a group of one or more ports. Packets with VLAN tags leave the switch chip through one or more ports that are set in the corresponding table entry. The exact logic that controls how packets with VLAN tags are treated is controlled by a `vlan-mode` parameter that is changeable per switch port.

VLAN ID based forwarding takes into account the MAC addresses dynamically learned or manually added in the host table. QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch-chips also support Independent VLAN Learning (IVL) which does the learning based on both - MAC addresses and VLAN IDs, thus allowing the same MAC to be used in multiple VLANs.

Packets without a VLAN tag are treated just as if they had a VLAN tag with port`default-vlan-id`. If `vlan-mode=check` or `vlan=mode=secure` is configured, to forward packets without VLAN tags you have to add an entry to the VLAN table with the same VLAN ID according to the `default-vlan-id`.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **disabled** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables switch VLAN entry. |
| **independent-learning** (no*\| yes*; Default: **yes**) | Whether to use shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) or independent-VLAN-learning (IVL). |
| **ports** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Interface member list for the respective VLAN. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g. `ports=ether1,ether2`. |
| **switch** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Name of the switch for which the respective VLAN entry is intended. |
| **vlan-id** (*integer: 0..4095*; Default:) | The VLAN ID for certain switch port configurations. |

:::warning
Devices with **MT7621**, **MT7531**, **EN7523, RTL8367**, **88E6393X**, **88E6191X**, **88E6190** switch chips support [HW offloaded vlan-filtering](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-vlan-filtering) in RouterOS v7. VLAN-related configuration on the `/interface/ethernet/switch` menu is not available.
:::

#### VLAN Forwarding

Both `vlan-mode` and `vlan-header` along with the VLAN Table can be used to configure VLAN tagging, untagging and filtering. Multiple combinations are possible, each achieving a different result. Below you can find a table of what kind of traffic is going to be sent out through an egress port when certain traffic is received on an ingress port for each VLAN Mode.

**NOTES:**

- **L** - `vlan-header` is set to `leave-as-is`
- **S** - `vlan-header` is set to `always-strip`
- **A** - `vlan-header` is set to `add-if-missing`
- **U** - Untagged traffic is sent out
- **T** - Tagged traffic is sent out, a tag is already present on the ingress port
- **TA** - Tagged traffic is sent out, a tag was added on the ingress port
- **DI** - Traffic is dropped on ingress port because of the mode selected in vlan-mode
- **DE** - Traffic is dropped on egress port because the egress port was not found in the VLAN Table
- **VID match** - VLAN ID from the VLAN tag for ingress traffic is present in the VLAN Table
- **Port match** - Ingress port is present in the VLAN Table for the appropriate VLAN ID

:::warning
The tables above are meant for more advanced configurations and to double-check your understanding of how packets will be processed with each VLAN related property.
:::

### Host Table

The host table represents switch chip's internal MAC address to port mapping. It can contain two kinds of entries: dynamic and static. Dynamic entries get added automatically. This is also called a learning process: when the switch chip receives a packet from a certain port, it adds the packet's source MAC address and the port it received the packet from to the host table, so when a packet comes in with the same destination MAC address, it knows to which port it should forward the packet. If the destination MAC address is not present in the host table (so-called unknown-unicast traffic), then it forwards the packet to all ports in the group. Dynamic entries take about 5 minutes to time out. Learning is enabled only on ports that are configured as part of the switch group, so you won't see dynamic entries if you have not set up port switching. Also, you can add static entries that take over dynamic entries if a dynamic entry with the same MAC address already exists. Since port switching is configured using a bridge with hardware offloading, any static entries created on one table (either bridge host or switch host) will appear on the opposite table as a dynamic entry. Adding a static entry on the switch host table will provide access to some more functionality that is controlled via the following params:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **copy-to-cpu** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a frame copy to the switch CPU port from a frame with a matching MAC destination address (matching destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches) |
| **drop** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to drop a frame with a matching MAC source address received on a certain port (matching destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches) |
| **mac-address** (*MAC;* Default: **00:00:00:00:00:00**) | Host's MAC address |
| **mirror** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a frame copy to the `mirror-target` port from a frame with a matching MAC destination address (matching destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches) |
| **ports** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Name of the interface, a static MAC address can be mapped to more than one port, including the switch CPU port |
| **redirect-to-cpu** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to redirect a frame to the switch CPU port from a frame with a matching MAC destination address (matching destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches) |
| **share-vlan-learned**(*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether the static host MAC address lookup is used with shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) or independent-VLAN-learning (IVL). The SVL mode is used for those VLAN entries that do not support IVL or IVL is disabled (independent-learning=no) |
| **switch** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Name of the switch to which the MAC address is going to be assigned |
| **vlan-id** (*integer: 0..4095*; Default:) | VLAN ID for the statically added MAC address entry |

:::warning
Every switch chip has a finite number of MAC addresses it can store on the chip, see the Introduction table for a specific host table size. Once a host table is full, different techniques can be utilized to cope with the situation, for example, the switch can remove older entries to free space for more recent MAC addresses (used on QCA-8337 and Atheros-8327 switch chips), another option is to simply ignore the new MAC addresses and only remove entries after a timeout has passed (used on Atheros8316, Atheros8227, Atheros-7240, ICPlus175D and Realtek-RTL8367 switch chips), the last option is a combination of the previous two - only allow a certain number of entries to be renewed and keep the other host portion intact till the timeout (used on MediaTek-MT7621, MT7531, EN7523 switch chips). These techniques cannot be changed with configuration.
:::

:::warning
For Atheros8316, Atheros8227 and Atheros-7240 switch chips, the switch-cpu port will always participate in the host learning process when at least one hardware offloaded bridge port is active on the switching group. It will cause the switch-cpu port to learn MAC addresses from non-HW offloaded interfaces. This might cause packet loss when a single bridge contains HW and non-HW offloaded interfaces. Also, packet loss might appear when a duplicate MAC address is used on the same switching group regardless of whether hosts are located on different logical networks. It is recommended to use HW offloading only when all bridge ports can use HW offloading or keep it disabled on all switch ports when one or more bridge ports cannot be configured with HW offloading.
:::

:::note
The switch chips **QCA-8337** and **Atheros-8327** automatically add reserved multicast MAC addresses (01:80:C2:00:00:0x) to the host table when a hardware-offloaded bridge is created with `forward-reserved-addresses=no` and `protocol-mode=stp/rstp`. These MACs should not be forwarded by 802.1Q compatible bridges and they are essential for correct operation with R/STP. Since the switch has a limited number of host table entries, these MAC addresses are only assigned to VLAN 1.
:::

:::info
To ensure packets with these destination MAC addresses are processed correctly:

- Switch ports should be set to default VLAN 1 (`default-vlan-id=auto` or `default-vlan-id=1`).
- If VLAN 1 is explicitly configured, it must use independent VLAN learning (`independent-learning=yes`).

:::

### Rule Table

Rule table is a very powerful tool allowing wire-speed packet filtering, forwarding and VLAN tagging based on L2, L3 and L4 protocol header field conditions. The menu contains an ordered list of rules just like in `/ip/firewall/filter`, so ACL rules are checked for each packet until a match has been found. If multiple rules can match, then only the first rule will be triggered. A rule without any action parameters is a rule to accept the packet.

Each rule contains a condition part and an action part. The action part is controlled by the following parameters:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **copy-to-cpu** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a packet copy to switch CPU port |
| **mirror** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Whether to send a packet copy to `mirror-target` port |
| **new-dst-ports** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Changes the destination port as specified, multiple ports allowed, including a switch CPU port. An empty setting will drop the packet. When the parameter is not used, the packet will be accepted |
| **new-vlan-id** (*integer: 0..4095*) | Changes the VLAN ID to the specified value or adds a new VLAN tag if one was not already present (the property only applies to the **Atheros8316** and **88E6393X** switch chips (**NOTE**: in case of 88E6393X switch chip, vlan-filtering=yes is also required)) |
| **new-vlan-priority** (*integer: 0..7*) | Changes the VLAN priority field (priority code point; the property only applies to **Atheros8327**, **QCA8337** and **Atheros8316** switch chips) |
| **rate** (*integer: 0..4294967295*) | Sets ingress traffic limitation (bits per second) for matched traffic and can only be applied to the first 32 rule slots (the property only applies to **Atheros8327/QCA8337** switch chips) |
| **redirect-to-cpu** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Changes the destination port of a matching packet to the switch CPU |

The conditions part is controlled by the rest of the parameters:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **disabled** (*no \| yes*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables the switch rule |
| **dscp** (*integer: 0..63*) | Matching DSCP field of the packet |
| **dst-address** (*IP address/Mask*) | Matching destination IP address and mask |
| **dst-address6** (*IPv6 address/Mask*) | Matching destination IPv6 address and mask |
| **dst-mac-address** (*MAC address/Mask*) | Matching destination MAC address and mask |
| **dst-port** (*integer:* *0..65535*) | Matching destination protocol port number or range |
| **flow-label** (*integer:* *0..1048575*) | Matching IPv6 flow label |
| **mac-protocol** (*802.2 \| arp \| capsman \| dot1x \| homeplug-av \| ip \| ipv6 \| ipx \| lacp \| lldp \| loop-protect \| macsec \| mpls-multicast \| mpls-unicast \| mvrp \| packing-compr \| packing-simple \| pppoe \| pppoe-discovery \| rarp \| romon \| service-vlan \| vlan \| or 0..65535 \| or 0x0000-0xffff*) | Matching a particular MAC protocol specified by protocol name or number (skips VLAN tags if any) |
| **ports** (*name*) | The Name of the interface on which the rule will apply to the received traffic, multiple ports are allowed. If the ports property is left empty, the rule will apply to all switch interfaces |
| **protocol** (*dccp \| ddp \| egp \| encap \| etherip \| ggp \| gre \| hmp \| icmp \| icmpv6 \| idpr-cmtp \| igmp \| ipencap \| ipip \| ipsec-ah \| ipsec-esp \| ipv6 \| ipv6-frag \| ipv6-nonxt \| ipv6-opts \| ipv6-route \| iso-tp4 \| l2tp \| ospf \| pim \| pup \| rdp \| rspf \| rsvp \| sctp \| st \| tcp \| udp \| udp-lite \| vmtp \| vrrp \| xns-idp \| xtp \| or 0..255*) | Matching a particular IP protocol specified by protocol name or number |
| **src-address** (*IP address/Mask*) | Matching source IP address and mask |
| **src-address6** (*IPv6 address/Mask*) | Matching source IPv6 address and mask |
| **src-mac-address** (*MAC address/Mask*) | Matching source MAC address and mask |
| **src-port** (*0..65535*) | Matching source protocol port number or range |
| **switch** (*switch group*) | Matching the switch group on which the rule will apply |
| **traffic-class** (*0..255*) | Matching IPv6 traffic class |
| **vlan-id** (*0..4095*) | Matching VLAN ID (the property only applies to the Atheros8316, Atheros8327, QCA8337, 88E6393X switch chips) |
| **vlan-header** (*not-present \| present*) | Matching VLAN header, whether the VLAN header is present or not (the property only applies to the Atheros8316, Atheros8327, QCA8337, 88E6393X switch chips. In case of **88E6393X** switch chip, vlan-filtering=yes is also required) |
| **vlan-priority** (*0..7*) | Matching VLAN priority (priority code point) |

:::warning
IPv4 and IPv6 specific conditions cannot be present in the same rule.
:::

:::warning
Because the rule table is processed entirely in switch chip hardware, there is a limitation on how many rules you may have. Depending on the number of conditions (MAC layer, IP layer, IPv6, L4 layer) you use in your rules, the number of active rules may vary from 8 to 32 for Atheros8316 switch chip, from 8 to 92 for Atheros8327/QCA8337 switch chip and from 42 to 256 for 88E6393X switch chip. You can always do `/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print` after modifying your rule set to see that no rules at the end of the list are 'invalid', which means those rules did not fit into the switch chip.
:::

### Port isolation

Port isolation provides the possibility to divide (isolate) certain parts of your network. This might be useful when you need to make sure that certain devices cannot access other devices. This can be done by isolating switch ports. Port isolation only works between ports that are members of the same switch. Switch port isolation is available on all switch chips since RouterOS v6.43.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **forwarding-override** (*interface*; Default: ) | Forces ingress traffic to be forwarded to a specific interface. Multiple interfaces can be specified by separating them with a comma. |

:::info
(R/M)STP will only work properly in PVLAN setups. (R/M)STP will not work properly in setups where there are multiple isolated switch groups, because switch groups might not properly receive BPDUs and therefore fail to detect network loops.
:::

:::warning
The `forwarding-override` property affects ingress traffic only. Switch ports that do not have the `forwarding-override` specified can send packets through all switch ports.
:::

:::warning
Switch chips with VLAN table support (**QCA8337**, **Atheros8327**, **Atheros8316**, **Atheros8227** and **Atheros7240**) can override the port isolation configuration when enabling a VLAN lookup on the switch port (the `vlan-mode` is set to `fallback`, `check` or `secure`). If additional port isolation is needed between ports on the same VLAN, a switch rule with a new-dst-ports property can be implemented. Other devices without switch rule support cannot overcome this limitation.
:::

#### Private VLAN

In some scenarios, you might need to forward all traffic to an uplink port while all other ports are isolated from each other. This kind of setup is called **Private VLAN** configuration. The **Switch** will forward all Ethernet frames directly to the uplink port allowing the **Router** to filter unwanted packets and limit access between devices that are behind switch ports.

![Port Isolation](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-02.webp)

To configure switch port isolation, you need to switch all required ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add interface=sfp1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
```

:::warning
By default, the bridge interface is configured with `protocol-mode` set to `rstp`. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) section with supported features.
:::

Override the egress port for each switch port that needs to be isolated (excluding the uplink port):

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port-isolation
set ether1 forwarding-override=sfp1
set ether2 forwarding-override=sfp1
set ether3 forwarding-override=sfp1
```

:::warning
It is possible to set multiple uplink ports for a single switch chip, this can be done by specifying multiple interfaces and separating them with a comma.
:::

#### Isolated switch groups

In some scenarios you might need to isolate a group of devices from other groups. This can be done using the switch port isolation feature. This is useful when you have multiple networks but you want to use a single switch. With port isolation you can allow certain switch ports to be able to communicate through only a set of switch ports. In this example, devices on **ether1-3** will only be able to communicate with devices that are on **ether1-3**, while devices on **ether4-5** will only be able to communicate with devices on **ether4-5** (**ether1-3** is not able to communicate with **ether4-5**).

:::warning
Port isolation is only available between ports that are members of the same switch.
:::

![Port Isolation 2](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-03.webp)

To configure isolated switch groups you must first switch all ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```

:::warning
By default, the bridge interface is configured with `protocol-mode` set to `rstp`. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) section with supported features.
:::

Then specify in the `forwarding-override` property all ports that you want to be in the same isolated switch group (except the port on which you are applying the property), for example, to create an isolated switch group for **A** devices:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port-isolation
set ether1 forwarding-override=ether2,ether3
set ether2 forwarding-override=ether1,ether3
set ether3 forwarding-override=ether1,ether2
```

To create an isolated switch group for **B** devices:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port-isolation
set ether4 forwarding-override=ether5
set ether5 forwarding-override=ether4
```

### CPU Flow Control

All switch chips have a special port that is called **switchX-cpu**. This is the CPU port for a switch chip. It is meant to forward traffic from a switch chip to the CPU. Such a port is required for management traffic and routing features. By default, the switch chip ensures that this special CPU port is not congested and sends out Pause Frames when link capacity is exceeded to make sure the port is not oversaturated. This feature is called **CPU Flow Control**. Without this feature, packets that might be crucial for routing or management purposes might get dropped.

Since RouterOS v6.43, it is possible to disable the CPU Flow Control feature on some devices that are using one of the following switch chips: QCA8337, Atheros8227, Atheros8327, Atheros7240, Atheros8316, 88E6191X and 88E6393X. Other switch chips have this feature enabled by default and cannot be changed. To disable CPU Flow Control, use the following command:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/set switch1 cpu-flow-control=no
```

### Statistics

Some switch chips are capable of reporting statistics, this can be useful to monitor how many packets are sent to the CPU from the built-in switch chip. These statistics can also be used to monitor CPU Flow Control. You can find an example of the switch chip's statistics below:

```ros

```

Some devices have multiple CPU cores that are directly connected to a built-in switch chip using separate data lanes. These devices can report which data lane was used to forward the packet from or to the CPU port from the switch chip. For such devices, an extra line is added for each row, the first line represents data that was sent using the first data lane, the second line represents data that was sent using the second data line, and so on. You can find an example of the switch chip's statistics for a device with multiple data lanes connecting the CPU and the built-in switch chip:

## Setup Examples

---

:::info
Make sure you have added all needed interfaces to the VLAN table when using secure `vlan-mode`. For routing functions to work properly on the same device through ports that use secure `vlan-mode`, you will need to allow access to the CPU from those ports; this can be done by adding the switchX-cpu interface itself to the VLAN table. Examples can be found in the [Management port](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md#management-access-configuration) section.
:::

:::note
It is possible to use the built-in switch chip and the CPU at the same time to create a Switch-Router setup, where a device acts as a switch and as a router at the same time. You can find a configuration example in the [Switch-Router](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md#inter-vlan-routing) section.
:::

:::warning
When allowing access to the CPU, you are allowing access from a certain port to the actual router/switch. This is not always desirable. Make sure you implement proper firewall filter rules to secure your device when access to the CPU is allowed from a certain VLAN ID and port. Use firewall filter rules to allow access to only certain services.
:::

:::warning
Devices with **MT7621**, **MT7531**, **EN7523, RTL8367**, **88E6393X**, **88E6191X,** **88E6190** switch chips support [HW offloaded vlan-filtering](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-vlan-filtering) in RouterOS v7. VLAN-related configuration on the `/interface/ethernet/switch` menu is not available.
:::

:::warning
For VLAN related matchers or VLAN related action parameters to work on the **88E6393X** switch chip, you need to enable vlan-filtering on the bridge interface and make sure that hardware offloading is enabled on those ports, otherwise, these parameters will not have any effect.
:::

### VLAN Example 1 (Trunk and Access Ports)

RouterBOARDs with Atheros switch chips can be used for 802.1Q Trunking. This feature in RouterOS v6 is supported by **QCA8337, Atheros8316, Atheros8327, Atheros8227** and **Atheros7240** switch chips. In this example, **ether3**, **ether4,** and **ether5** interfaces are access ports, while **ether2** is a trunk port. VLAN IDs for each access port: ether3 - 200, ether4 - 300, ether5 - 400.

![Access Ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-04.webp)

Switch together the required ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```

:::warning
By default, the bridge interface is configured with `protocol-mode` set to `rstp`. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) section with supported features.
:::

Add VLAN table entries to allow frames with specific VLAN IDs between ports:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether2,ether3 switch=switch1 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether4 switch=switch1 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=400
```

Assign `vlan-mode` and `vlan-header` mode for each port and also `default-vlan-id` on ingress for each access port:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether2 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=add-if-missing
set ether3 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=200
set ether4 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=300
set ether5 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=400
```

- Setting `vlan-mode=secure` ensures strict use of the VLAN table.
- Setting `vlan-header=always-strip` for access ports removes the VLAN header from the frame when it leaves the switch chip.
- Setting `vlan-header=add-if-missing` for trunk port adds VLAN header to untagged frames.
- `default-vlan-id` specifies what VLAN ID is added for untagged ingress traffic of the access port.

:::warning
On **QCA8337** and **Atheros8327** switch chips, a default `vlan-header=leave-as-is` property should be used. The switch chip will determine which ports are access ports by using the `default-vlan-id` property. The `default-vlan-id` should only be used on access/hybrid ports to specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
:::

### VLAN Example 2 (Trunk and Hybrid Ports)

VLAN Hybrid ports can forward both tagged and untagged traffic. This configuration is supported only by some Gigabit switch chips (**QCA8337, Atheros8327**).

![Hybrid Ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-05.webp)

Switch together the required ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```

:::warning
By default, the bridge interface is configured with `protocol-mode` set to `rstp`. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) section with supported features.
:::

Add VLAN table entries to allow frames with specific VLAN IDs between ports.

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=400
```

In the switch port menu set `vlan-mode` on all ports and also `default-vlan-id` on planned hybrid ports:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether2 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is
set ether3 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=200
set ether4 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=300
set ether5 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=400
```

- `vlan-mode=secure` will ensure strict use of the VLAN table.
- `default-vlan-id` will define VLAN for untagged ingress traffic on the port.
- In QCA8337 and Atheros8327 chips when `vlan-mode=secure` is used, it ignores switch port `vlan-header` options. VLAN table entries handle all the egress tagging/untagging and work as `vlan-header=leave-as-is` on all ports. It means what comes in tagged, goes out tagged as well, only `default-vlan-id` frames are untagged at the egress port.

### Management access configuration

In these examples, there will be shown examples for multiple scenarios, but each of these scenarios requires you to have switched ports. Below you can find how to switch multiple ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
```

:::warning
By default, the bridge interface is configured with `protocol-mode` set to `rstp`. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the [Bridge Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) section with supported features.
:::

In these examples, it will be assumed that **ether1** is the trunk port and **ether2** is the access port, for configuration as follows:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=100
```

#### Tagged

To make the device accessible only from a certain VLAN, you need to create a new VLAN interface on the bridge interface and assign an IP address to it:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add name=MGMT vlan-id=99 interface=bridge1
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```

Specify from which interfaces it is allowed to access the device:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether1,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=99
```

:::warning
Only specify trunk ports in this VLAN table entry. It is not possible to allow access to the CPU with tagged traffic through an access port since the access port will tag all ingress traffic with the specified `default-vlan-id` value.
:::

When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable `vlan-mode=secure` to limit access to the CPU:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```

#### Untagged

To make the device accessible from the access port, create a VLAN interface with the same VLAN ID as set in `default-vlan-id`, for example, VLAN 100, and add an IP address to it:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add name=VLAN100 vlan-id=100 interface=bridge1
/ip/address
add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=VLAN100
```

Specify which access (untagged) ports are allowed to access the CPU:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=100
```

:::danger
Most commonly an access (untagged) port is accompanied by a trunk (tagged) port. In case of untagged access to the CPU, you are forced to specify both the access port and the trunk port. This gives access to the CPU from the trunk port as well. This is not always desired and a Firewall might be required on top of VLAN filtering.
:::

When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable `vlan-mode=secure` to limit access to the CPU:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```

:::warning
To set up the management port using untagged traffic on a device with the **Atheros7240** switch chip, you will need to set `vlan-header=add-if-missing` for the CPU port.
:::

#### Untagged from tagged port

It is possible to allow access to the device from the trunk (tagged) port with untagged traffic. To do so, assign an IP address to the bridge interface:

```ros
/ip/address
add address=10.0.0.1/24 interface=bridge1
```

Specify which ports are allowed to access the CPU. Use the `vlan-id` that is used in `default-vlan-id` for switch-cpu and trunk ports, by default it is set to 0 or 1.

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add ports=ether1,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=1
```

When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable `vlan-mode=secure` to limit access to the CPU:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether1 default-vlan-id=1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu default-vlan-id=1 vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```

:::warning
This configuration example is not possible for devices with the **Atheros8316** and **Atheros7240** switch chips. For devices with **QCA8337** and **Atheros8327** switch chips, it is possible to use any other `default-vlan-id` as long as it stays the same on switch-cpu and trunk ports. For devices with **Atheros8227** switch chip, only `default-vlan-id=0` can be used and the trunk port must use `vlan-header=leave-as-is`.
:::

### Inter-VLAN routing

Many MikroTik devices come with a built-in switch chip that can be used to greatly improve overall throughput when configured properly. Devices with a switch chip can be used as a router and a switch at the same time. This gives you the possibility to use a single device instead of multiple devices for your network.

![Switch Router](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/img/switch-chip-features-06.webp)

For this type of setup to work, you must switch all required ports together

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
```

Create a VLAN interface for each VLAN ID and assign an IP address to it:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN20 vlan-id=20
/ip/address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=VLAN10
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN20
```

Setup a DHCP Server for each VLAN:

```ros
/ip/pool
add name=POOL10 ranges=192.168.10.100-192.168.10.200
add name=POOL20 ranges=192.168.20.100-192.168.20.200
/ip/dhcp-server
add address-pool=POOL10 disabled=no interface=VLAN10 name=DHCP10
add address-pool=POOL20 disabled=no interface=VLAN20 name=DHCP20
/ip/dhcp-server/network
add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.10.1
add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.20.1
```

Enable NAT on the device:

```ros
/ip/firewall/nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1
```

Add each port to the VLAN table and allow these ports to access the CPU to make DHCP and routing work:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan
add independent-learning=yes ports=ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add independent-learning=yes ports=ether3,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=20
```

Specify each port to be an access port, and enable secure VLAN mode on each port and on the switch1-cpu port:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/port
set ether2 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set ether3 default-vlan-id=20 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-mode=secure
```

:::warning
On **QCA8337** and **Atheros8327** switch chips, a default `vlan-header=leave-as-is` property should be used. The switch chip will determine which ports are access ports by using the `default-vlan-id` property. The `default-vlan-id` should only be used on access/hybrid ports to specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
:::

If your device has a switch rule table, then you can limit access between VLANs on a hardware level. As soon as you add an IP address on the VLAN interface, you enable inter-VLAN routing, but this can be limited on a hardware level while preserving DHCP Server and other router-related services. To do so, use these ACL rules. With this type of configuration, you can achieve isolated port groups using VLANs.

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/rule
add dst-address=192.168.20.0/24 new-dst-ports="" ports=ether2 switch=switch1
add dst-address=192.168.10.0/24 new-dst-ports="" ports=ether3 switch=switch1
```
