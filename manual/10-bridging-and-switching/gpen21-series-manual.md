# GPEN21 series Manual

## Summary

The GPEN21 is a smart power injector that serves as an advanced software-controlled repeater. Not only can it power your uplink devices via PoE, but it can also provide a range of useful software features. GPEN21 has an Ethernet and SFP port for fiber connectivity. Customers can choose to use GPEN21 to power an optical module for uplink to the provider, or to provide PoE to power Ethernet uplink to the provider (that uses our GPeR and/or netPower products). The GPEN21 unit can be securely attached to a wall or the communications cabinet. The Ethernet cable can be routed either directly through its bottom cable opening or into the wall, as preferred.

SwOS Lite is an operating system designed specifically for the administration of MikroTik GPEN21 products. GPEN21 supports only the SwOS Lite operating system.

## System

System Tab performs the following functions:

- General information about the device
- Device management
- Configuration reset
- Backup and restore configuration

> **Note:** SwOS uses a simple algorithm to ensure TCP/IP communication - it just replies to the same IP and MAC address packet came from. This way there is no need for Default Gateway on the device itself.

![Gpen21 system](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-02.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Address Acquisition** | Specify which address acquisition method to use:`DHCP with fallback` - device is trying to request an IPv4 address from a DHCP server. If the requests are unsuccessful, then the device can be accessed using a **Static IP Address** value`static` - address is set as a **Static IP Address** value (IPv4 only)`DHCP only` - device uses DHCPv4 client to acquire address |
| **Static IP Address** | IP address of the device in case of **Address Acquisition** is set as `DHCP with fallback` or `static` |
| **Identity** | Name of the device (for Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery protocol) |
| **Allow From** | IP address from which the device is accessible. Default value is `0.0.0.0/0` - any address |
| **Allow From Ports** | List of device ports from which it is accessible |
| **Allow From VLAN** | VLAN ID from which the service is accessible. Make sure to first configure VLANs and VLAN pages |
| **Watchdog** | Enable or disable system Watchdog. It will reset the CPU of the device in case of a fault condition |

## Link

Link Tab allows you to configure each interface settings and monitor the link status.

![Gpen21 link](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-04.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enabled** | Enable or disable port |
| **Name** | Editable port name |
| **Link Status** | Current link status (read-only) |
| **Auto Negotiation** | Enable or disable auto-negotiation |
| **Speed** | Shows the negotiated speed, or allows manually changing the speed setting of the port (requires auto-negotiation to be disabled) |

## SFP

The SFP tab allows you to monitor the status of SFP modules.

![Gpen21 sfp](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-05.webp)

---

## Forwarding

Forwarding Tab provides advanced forwarding options among device ports, port locking, bandwidth limit, and broadcast storm control features.

![Gpen21 forwarding](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-06.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Port Lock** | `Port Lock` - Enables or disables MAC address learning on this port. When the option is enabled, it will restrict MAC address learning and static MAC addresses should be configured. Any received frames with an unknown source MAC address will be dropped.`Lock On First` - Allows learning of the source MAC address from the first received frame; this property should be used together with `Port Lock`. Learning of the first MAC address will reset every time an interface status changes. |
| **Uplink Port** | `Set As Uplink Port` - Allows changing the uplink port between PoE-in (Port1), PoE-out (Port2), or SFP interfaces. Packets received on downstream ports are forwarded only to the uplink port; only a single interface can be used as an uplink. |
| **Broadcast Storm Control** | `Storm Rate` - Limit the number of broadcast packets transmitted by an interface. The rate is measured in bits per second (bps).`Limit Unknown Unicast` - Include unicast packets without an entry in the host table in `Storm Rate` limitation. |
| **Bandwidth Limit** | `Ingress Rate` - Limit traffic entering this port (bps)`Egress Rate` - Limit traffic leaving this port (bps) |

> **Note:** It is possible to limit ingress/egress traffic per port basis. The policer is used for ingress traffic, the shaper is used for egress traffic. The ingress policer controls the received traffic with packet drops — everything that exceeds the defined limit will get dropped. This can affect the TCP congestion control mechanism on end hosts and achieved bandwidth can be actually less than defined. The egress shaper tries to queue packets that exceed the limit instead of dropping them. Eventually, it will also drop packets when the output queue gets full; however, it should allow utilizing the defined throughput better.

---

## Stats, Errors and Histogram

These menus provide detailed information about received and transmitted packets.

![Gpen21 stats](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-07.webp)

## VLAN and VLANs

VLAN configuration for device ports.

![Gpen21 vlan](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-10.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VLAN Mode** (*disabled \| optional \| strict*; Default: **optional**) | VLAN filtering mode; these options are relevant to egress ports (except for strict mode).`disabled` - VLAN table is not used. The device discards packets with a VLAN tag on egress ports. If the packet has a VLAN tag and the VLAN ID matches `Default VLAN ID` on egress ports, then with `VLAN Receive=any` the device will remove the VLAN tag and forward the packet.`optional` - Disabled VLAN filtering. Handle packets with VLAN tag ID that is not present in the VLAN table just like packets without VLAN tag.`strict` - Enabled VLAN filtering with additional ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the VLAN table. Received packets on the ingress port with a VLAN ID that does not match with the VLAN table will be dropped. Default VLAN ID must be specified for access ports since it will be used to tag ingress traffic and untag egress traffic for a certain port. |
| **VLAN Receive** (*any \| only tagged \| only untagged*; Default: **optional**) | Received traffic filtering based on VLAN tag presence.`any` - allows tagged and untagged packets on a certain port`only tagged` - allows only packets with a VLAN tag. The "Default VLAN ID" will not work, because it only applies for untagged traffic`only untagged` - allows only packets without a VLAN tag |
| **Default VLAN ID** (*integer: 1..4095*; Default: **1**) | The device will place received untagged packets in the "Default VLAN ID" VLAN. Only has an effect on untagged traffic, and when **VLAN Receive** is set to "any" or "only untagged". It does not apply for tagged traffic. This parameter is usually used to allocate access ports with a specific VLAN. It is also used to untag egress traffic if the packet's VLAN ID matches Default VLAN ID. |
| **Force VLAN ID** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Assigns the `Default VLAN ID` value to all ingress traffic (tagged and untagged). Has effect in all VLAN Modes. If the port receives tagged traffic and `Default VLAN ID` is set to 1, then with this parameter the egress traffic will be untagged. |

VLAN membership configuration for device ports.

![Gpen21 vlans](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-11.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VLAN ID** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **0**) | VLAN ID to which assign ports |
| **Members** (*ports*; Default: **none**) | Group of ports which are allowed to forward traffic on the defined VLAN |

### VLAN Configuration Examples

The VLAN configuration examples are taken from the [CSS610 switch user manual](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/SWOS/CSS610+series+Manual#CSS610seriesManual-VLANConfigurationExample); however, the same principles can be applied to the GPEN21 device.

#### Trunk and Access Ports

![Access ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-12.webp)

1. In the VLANs menu add VLAN entries and specify port membership.

![Css610 vlans](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-13.webp)

1. In the VLAN menu configure Default VLAN ID on planned access ports (untagged), select the correct VLAN Receive setting (Port2 only tagged, Port6-8 only untagged) and enable strict VLAN filtering to ensure only allowed VLANs can pass through the ports.

![Css610 vlan](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-14.webp)

#### Trunk and Hybrid Ports

![Hybrid ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-15.webp)

1. In the VLANs menu add VLAN entries and specify port membership.

![Css610 vlans hybrid](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-16.webp)

1. In the VLAN menu configure Default VLAN ID on planned hybrid ports (for untagged VLAN), select the correct VLAN Receive setting (Port2 only tagged, Port6-8 any) and enable strict VLAN filtering to ensure only allowed VLANs can pass through the ports.

![Css610 vlan hybrid](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-17.webp)

#### Management Access

In this example, device management access on VLAN 200 will be created. The configuration scheme is the same as "**Trunk and Access Ports**" and steps **1., 2.** are identical. The additional **3rd** step requires specifying the management VLAN ID in the System menu. After applying the configuration, the device will only respond to tagged VLAN 200 packets on Port2 and untagged packets on Port6. The DHCP client will also work in the specified VLAN ID.

![Css610 system vlan](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-18.webp)

> **Warning:** Changing management VLAN can completely disable access to the device management if VLAN settings are not correctly configured. Save a configuration backup before changing this setting and use [Reset and Reinstall](#reset-and-reinstall) in case management access is lost.

---

## Hosts

This table represents dynamically learned MAC address to port mapping entries. It can contain two kinds of entries: dynamic and static. Dynamic entries get added automatically — this is also called a learning process: when a device receives a packet from a certain port, it adds the packet's source MAC address and port it received the packet from to the host table, so when a packet comes in with a certain destination MAC address it knows to which port it should forward the packet. If the destination MAC address is not present in the host table then it forwards the packet to all ports in the group. Dynamic entries take about 5 minutes to time out.

Static entries will take over dynamic entries if a dynamic entry with the same MAC address already exists. Adding a static entry also provides access to more functionality.

![Gpen21 hosts](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-19.webp)

**Static host properties**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ports** | Ports the packet should be forwarded to |
| **MAC** | MAC address |

**Dynamic host properties (read-only)**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Port** | Ports the packet should be forwarded to |
| **MAC** | Learned MAC address |

---

## SNMP

SwOS supports SNMP v1 and v2c (the Response for GetRequest, GetNextRequest and GetBulkRequest) and uses IF-MIB, SNMPv2-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB and MIKROTIK-MIB (only for health, PoE-out and SFP diagnostics). SNMP traps and writing SwOS configuration are not supported.

Available SNMP data:

- System information
- System uptime
- Port status
- Interface statistics
- Host table information

![Swos snmp2 1](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-20.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enabled** | Enable or disable SNMP service |
| **Community** | SNMP community name |
| **Contact Info** | Contact information for the NMS |
| **Location** | Location information for the NMS |

---

## ACL

An access control list (ACL) rule table is a very powerful tool allowing wire-speed packet filtering, forwarding, and VLAN tagging based on L2, L3, and L4 protocol header field conditions. Each rule contains a conditions part and an action part.

![Gpen21 acl](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/gpen21-21.webp)

**Conditions part parameters**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **From** | A port that the packet came in from |
| **MAC Src** | Source MAC address and mask |
| **MAC Dst** | Destination MAC address and mask |
| **Ethertype** | Protocol encapsulated in the payload of an Ethernet Frame |
| **VLAN** | VLAN header presence: `any` / `present` / `not present` |
| **VLAN ID** | VLAN tag ID |
| **Priority** | Priority in VLAN tag |
| **IP Src** (IP/netmask:port) | Source IPv4 address, netmask, and L4 port number |
| **IP Dst** (IP/netmask:port) | Destination IPv4 address, netmask, and L4 port number |
| **Protocol** *(integer)* | IP protocol |
| **DSCP** | IP DSCP field |

**Action part parameters**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Drop** | Drop packet |
| **Set VLAN ID** | Changes the VLAN tag ID, if the VLAN tag is present |
| **Priority** | Changes the VLAN tag priority bits, if the VLAN tag is present |

---

## Reset and Reinstall

The GPEN21 has built-in backup SwOS firmware which can be loaded in case standard firmware breaks or an upgrade fails:

- Holding the Reset button for a few seconds while the device is booting will reset the configuration and load backup firmware. The reset button is located behind the front cover.
- After loading backup firmware, it is possible to connect to 192.168.88.1 (or a leased address from a DHCP server) using a web browser and install new SwOS firmware.
