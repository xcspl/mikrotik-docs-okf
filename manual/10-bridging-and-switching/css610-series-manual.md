## Connecting to the Switch

Open your web browser and enter the IP address of your switch (192.168.88.1 by default) and a login screen will appear. The switch can also run a DHCP client, see if a different IP address has been assigned by the DHCP server.

![Swos login css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-01.webp)

SwOS default IP address: **192.168.88.1**, user name: **admin** and there is no password.

[MikroTik Neighbor Discovery](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/system-information-and-utilities/neighbor-discovery) can be used to discover the IP address of the Mikrotik switch. LLDP is not supported.

## System

System Tab performs the following functions:

- General information about switch
- Switch management
- Configuration reset
- Backup and restore configuration

> **Note:** SwOS uses a simple algorithm to ensure TCP/IP communication - it just replies to the same IP and MAC address packet came from. This way there is no need for Default Gateway on the device itself.

![Swos system css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-02.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Address Acquisition** | Specify which address acquisition method to use:`DHCP with fallback` - switch is trying to request an IPv4 address from a DHCP server. If the requests are unsuccessful, then the switch can be accessed using a **Static IP Address** value`static` - address is set as a **Static IP Address** value (IPv4 only)`DHCP only` - switch uses DHCPv4 client to acquire address |
| **Static IP Address** | IP address of the switch in case of **Address Acquisition** is set as `DHCP with fallback` or `static` |
| **Identity** | Name of the switch (for Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery protocol) |
| **Allow From** | IP address from which the switch is accessible. Default value is `0.0.0.0/0` - any address |
| **Allow From Ports** | List of switch ports from which it is accessible |
| **Allow From VLAN** | VLAN ID from which the service is accessible. Make sure to first configure VLANs and VLAN pages |
| **Watchdog** | Enable or disable system Watchdog. It will reset CPU of the switch in case of fault condition |
| **IGMP Snooping** | Enable or disable IGMP Snooping |
| **IGMP Querier** | Enables or disables IGMP querier on the switch. Only applies when IGMP Snooping is enabled |
| **IGMP Fast Leave** | Enables or disables IGMP fast leave feature per switch port |
| **IGMP Version** | Changes IGMP version for switch querier. Only applies when IGMP Querier is enabled |

For power-on to happen there should be resistance on spare pairs in the range from 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ`forced-on` - detection range is removed. As a result power over Ethernet will be always on`off` - all detection and power is turned off for this port |
| **PoE Out Status** | Shows current PoE-Out status on port (read-only, CSS610-1Gi-7R-2S+ model only) |

### Health

![Swos lite health](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-03.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Temperature** | Shows CPU temperature in celsius temperature scale (read-only) |
| **PSU** | Shows PSU voltage and consumed milliamperes by PoE-out connected devices (read-only, CSS610-8P-2S+IN model only) |
| **Power Consumption** | Shows PSU power consumption by PoE-out connected devices (read-only, CSS610-8P-2S+IN model only) |

### DHCP & PPPoE Snooping

![CSS610 DHCP Snooping](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-04.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Trusted Ports** | Group of ports which allows DHCP or PPPoE servers to provide requested information. When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCP client packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to limit unauthorized servers from providing malicious information for users; access ports usually are not configured as trusted. Ports that receive DHCP client packets with already added Option-82 must also be trusted, otherwise these packets are dropped. The setting does not apply to DHCPv6 packets. |
| **Add Information Option** | Enables or disables DHCP Option-82 information. When enabled, the Option-82 information (Agent Remote ID and Circuit ID) is added for DHCP packets received from untrusted ports. Can be used together with an Option-82 capable DHCP server to assign IP addresses and implement policies. The setting does not apply to DHCPv6 packets.For Agent Remote ID, SwOS uses the interface name where DHCP client resides. For Agent Circuit ID, SwOS uses the identity of the SwOS device, internally used port ID and VLAN ID. For example:Agent Remote ID - `Port1`Agent Circuit ID - `MikroTik eth 0/1:100` |

### Password and Backup

![Swos system3 css326](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-05.webp)

## Link

Link Tab allows you to configure each interface settings and monitor the link status.

![Css610 link](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-06.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |

The switch supports Jumbo frames up to 10218 bytes. Manually decreasing the MTU settings is not supported for SwOS Lite devices.

---

## PoE

Devices with PoE-out support have some configuration options and certain monitoring features, like PoE-out current, voltage, etc. For a more detailed description, see [PoE-Out manual](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/PoE-Out).

![SwOS PoE](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-07.webp)

---

## SFP

SFP tab allows you to monitor the status of SFP/SFP+ modules.

![Swos sfp1 css326](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-08.webp)

---

## Port Isolation

The Port Isolation table allows or restricts traffic forwarding between specific ports. By default, all available switch chip ports can communicate with any other port — there is no isolation used. When the checkbox is enabled/ticked you allow traffic to forward from this port towards the ticked port. Below are some port isolation examples.

![SwOS Isolated Groups](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-09.webp)

In some scenarios, you might need to isolate a group of devices from other groups. In this example devices on **Port1-Port5** are not able to communicate with **Port6-Port10** devices, and vice versa.

![SwOS Private VLAN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-10.webp)

In some scenarios, you might need to forward all traffic to an uplink port while all other ports are isolated from each other. This kind of setup is called a **Private VLAN** configuration. The switch will forward all Ethernet frames only to the uplink **Port1**, while the uplink can reach all other ports.

![SwO isolation example3](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-11.webp)

Individual isolated **Port1** (e.g. for management purpose) — it cannot send or receive traffic from any other port.

> **Note:** It is possible to check/uncheck multiple checkboxes by checking one of them and then dragging horizontally (Click & Drag).

> **Note:** (R)STP will only work properly in Private VLAN setups. In setups with multiple isolated switch groups, (R)STP might not properly receive BPDUs and therefore fail to detect network loops.

---

## LAG

IEEE 802.3ad (LACP) compatible link aggregation is supported, as well as static link aggregation to ensure failover and load balancing based only on Layer2 hashing. Up to 16 link aggregation groups with up to 8 ports per group are supported. Each individual port can be configured as Passive LACP, Active LACP, or a Static LAG port.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode** *(default: passive)* | Specify LACP packet exchange mode or Static LAG mode on ports:`Passive` - place port in listening state, use LACP only when its contrary port uses active LACP mode`Active` - prefer to start LACP regardless of contrary port mode`Static` - set port in a Static LAG mode; requires setting the same **Group** setting for all ports that need to be included in the same static LAG |
| **Group** | Specify a Static LAG group |
| **Trunk** *(read-only)* | Represents group number the port belongs to |
| **Partner** *(read-only)* | Represents partner MAC address; only available when ports are included in LACP |

---

## Forwarding

Forwarding Tab provides advanced forwarding options among switch ports, port locking, port mirroring, bandwidth limit, and broadcast storm control features.

![Swos forw css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-12.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Port Lock** | `Port Lock` - Enables or disables MAC address learning on this port. When the option is enabled, it will restrict MAC address learning and static MAC addresses should be configured. Any received frames with unknown source MAC address will be dropped`Lock On First` - Allows learning of the source MAC address from the first received frame; this property should be used together with `Port Lock`. Learning of the first MAC address will reset every time an interface status changes |
| **Port Mirroring** | `Mirror Ingress` - Whether traffic entering this port must be copied and forwarded to the mirroring target port`Mirror Egress` - Whether traffic leaving this port must be copied and forwarded to the mirroring target port`Mirror To` - Mirroring target port |
| **Broadcast Storm Control** | `Storm Rate` - Limit the number of broadcast packets transmitted by an interface. The rate is measured in bits per second (bps)`Include Unknown Unicast` - Include unicast packets without an entry in the host table in `Storm Rate` limitation |
| **Multicast Flood Control** | `Flood Unknown Multicast` - Changes the multicast flood option on a switch port; only controls egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast packets to the specified switch port; when disabled, it restricts multicast traffic from being flooded. The setting affects all multicast traffic, including non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1) |
| **Bandwidth Limit** | `Ingress Rate` - Limit traffic entering this port (bps)`Egress Rate` - Limit traffic leaving this port (bps) |

> **Note:** It is possible to limit ingress/egress traffic per port basis. The policer is used for ingress traffic, the shaper is used for egress traffic. The ingress policer controls the received traffic with packet drops — everything that exceeds the defined limit will get dropped. This can affect the TCP congestion control mechanism on end hosts and achieved bandwidth can be actually less than defined. The egress shaper tries to queue packets that exceed the limit instead of dropping them. Eventually, it will also drop packets when the output queue gets full; however, it should allow utilizing the defined throughput better.

---

## RSTP

Per-port and global RSTP configuration and monitoring are available in the RSTP menu.

![Swos rstp css326](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-13.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Bridge Priority (hex)** | RSTP bridge priority for Root Bridge selection |
| **Port Cost Mode** | There are two methods for automatically detecting RSTP port cost depending on link speed.`short`: 40G - 1; 10G - 2; 1G - 4; 100M - 10; 10M - 100`long`: 40G - 500; 10G - 2000; 1G - 20000; 100M - 200000; 10M - 2000000 |
| **Forward Reserved Multicast** | Whether to forward IEEE reserved multicast MAC address that are in the **01:80:C2:00:00:0x** range. Switches compliant with R/M/STP standards should refrain from forwarding these packets.If you enable this setting, SwOS will forward reserved multicast MAC packets and disable RSTP:- the switch will not process incoming BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units)- it will also not send its own BPDUs- Bridge Priority and per-port RSTP configuration settings will no longer have any effect.Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links, using bridge as media converters, or conducting network analysis).Notable MAC addresses and protocol examples (used by RouterOS):`01:80:C2:00:00:00` - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)`01:80:C2:00:00:01` - Ethernet Flow Control`01:80:C2:00:00:02` - Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)`01:80:C2:00:00:03` - Dot1x client and server`01:80:C2:00:00:08` - Spanning Tree Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using `ether-type=0x88a8`)`01:80:C2:00:00:0D` - Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using `ether-type=0x88a8`)`01:80:C2:00:00:0E` - Link Layer Discovery Protocol, Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group and Precision Time ProtocolThe Flow Control MAC address `01:80:C2:00:00:01` is an exception — it does not get forwarded by SwOS. |
| **Root Bridge** | The priority and MAC address of the selected Root Bridge in the network (read-only) |
| **RSTP** | Enable or disable STP/RSTP functionality on this port |
| **Mode** | Shows STP/RSTP functionality mode on a specific port (read-only):`RSTP``STP` |
| **Role** | Shows specific port role (read-only):`root` - port that is facing towards the root bridge and will be used to forward traffic from/to the root bridge`alternate` - port that is facing towards root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic (a backup for root port)`backup` - port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic (a backup for non-root port)`designated` - port that is facing away from the root bridge and is going to forward traffic`disabled` - port that is not strictly part of STP (RSTP functionality is disabled) |
| **Root Path Cost** | Shows root path cost for ports that are facing root bridge (read-only) |
| **Type** | `edge` - ports that are not supposed to receive any BPDUs, should be connected to the end station (read-only)`point-to-point` - ports that operate in full-duplex links, can be part of STP and operate in a forwarding state (read-only) |
| **State** | Shows each port state (read-only):`forwarding` - port participates in traffic forwarding and is learning MAC addresses, is receiving BPDUs`discarding` - port does not participate in traffic forwarding and is not learning MAC addresses, is receiving BPDU`learning` - port does not participate in traffic forwarding but is learning MAC addresses |

## VLAN and VLANs

VLAN configuration for switch ports.

![Swos vlan css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-17.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VLAN Mode** (*disabled \| optional \| strict*; Default: **optional**) | VLAN filtering mode; these options are relevant to egress ports (except for strict mode).`disabled` - VLAN table is not used. The switch discards packets with a VLAN tag on egress ports. If the packet has a VLAN tag and the VLAN ID matches `Default VLAN ID` on egress ports, then with `VLAN Receive=any` the switch will remove the VLAN tag and forward the packet.`optional` - Disabled VLAN filtering. Handle packets with VLAN tag ID that is not present in the VLAN table just like packets without VLAN tag.`strict` - Enabled VLAN filtering with additional ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the VLAN table. Received packets on the ingress port with a VLAN ID that does not match the VLAN table will be dropped. Default VLAN ID must be specified for access ports since it will be used to tag ingress traffic and untag egress traffic for a certain port. |
| **VLAN Receive** (*any \| only tagged \| only untagged*; Default: **optional**) | Received traffic filtering based on VLAN tag presence.`any` - allows tagged and untagged packets on a certain port`only tagged` - allows only packets with a VLAN tag. The "Default VLAN ID" will not work, because it only applies for untagged traffic`only untagged` - allows only packets without a VLAN tag |
| **Default VLAN ID** (*integer: 1..4095*; Default: **1**) | The switch will place received untagged packets in the "Default VLAN ID" VLAN. Only has an effect on untagged traffic, and when **VLAN Receive** is set to "any" or "only untagged". It does not apply for tagged traffic. This parameter is usually used to allocate access ports with a specific VLAN. It is also used to untag egress traffic if the packet's VLAN ID matches Default VLAN ID. |
| **Force VLAN ID** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Assigns the `Default VLAN ID` value to all ingress traffic (tagged and untagged). Has effect in all VLAN Modes. If the port receives tagged traffic and `Default VLAN ID` is set to 1, then with this parameter the egress traffic will be untagged. |

VLAN membership configuration for switch ports.

![Swos vlans css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-18.webp)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VLAN ID** (*integer: 1..4095*; Default: **0**) | VLAN ID to which assign ports |
| **IGMP Snooping** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables IGMP Snooping on the defined VLAN. When enabled, the switch will listen to IGMP Join and Leave requests from the defined VLAN and only forward traffic to ports which have sent IGMP membership requests from the defined VLAN. When disabled, the switch will flood all VLAN member ports with Multicast traffic. |
| **Members** (*ports*; Default: **none**) | Group of ports which are allowed to forward traffic on the defined VLAN |

### VLAN Configuration Examples

#### Trunk and Access Ports

![Access ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-19.webp)

1. In the VLANs menu add VLAN entries and specify port membership.

![Css610 vlans](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-20.webp)

1. In the VLAN menu configure Default VLAN ID on planned access ports (untagged), select the correct VLAN Receive setting (Port2 only tagged, Port6-8 only untagged) and enable strict VLAN filtering to ensure only allowed VLANs can pass through the ports.

![Css610 vlan](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-21.webp)

#### Trunk and Hybrid Ports

![Hybrid ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-22.webp)

1. In the VLANs menu add VLAN entries and specify port membership.

![Css610 vlans hybrid](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-23.webp)

1. In the VLAN menu configure Default VLAN ID on planned hybrid ports (for untagged VLAN), select the correct VLAN Receive setting (Port2 only tagged, Port6-8 any) and enable strict VLAN filtering to ensure only allowed VLANs can pass through the ports.

![Css610 vlan hybrid](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-24.webp)

#### Management Access

In this example, switch management access on VLAN 200 will be created. The configuration scheme is the same as "**Trunk and Access Ports**" and steps **1., 2.** are identical. The additional **3rd** step requires specifying the management VLAN ID in the System menu. After applying the configuration, the switch will only respond to tagged VLAN 200 packets on Port2 and untagged packets on Port6. The DHCP client will also work in the specified VLAN ID.

![Css610 system vlan](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-25.webp)

> **Warning:** Changing management VLAN can completely disable access to the switch management if VLAN settings are not correctly configured. Save a configuration backup before changing this setting and use [Reset and Reinstall](#reset-and-reinstall) in case management access is lost.

---

## Hosts

This table represents dynamically learned MAC address to port mapping entries. It can contain two kinds of entries: dynamic and static. Dynamic entries get added automatically — this is also called a learning process: when a switch receives a packet from a certain port, it adds the packet's source MAC address and port it received the packet from to the host table, so when a packet comes in with a certain destination MAC address it knows to which port it should forward the packet. If the destination MAC address is not present in the host table then it forwards the packet to all ports in the group. Dynamic entries take about 5 minutes to time out.

Static entries will take over dynamic entries if a dynamic entry with the same MAC address already exists. Adding a static entry also provides access to more functionality.

![Swos shost css610](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-26.webp)

**Static host properties**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ports** | Ports the packet should be forwarded to |
| **MAC** | MAC address |

**Dynamic host properties (read-only)**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Port** | Ports the packet should be forwarded to |
| **MAC** | Learned MAC address |

## IGMP Snooping

IGMP Snooping controls multicast streams and prevents multicast flooding. The feature allows a switch to listen in the IGMP conversation between hosts and routers.

Enable this option under the System tab.

![Css610 igmp snooping](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-27.webp)

Available IGMP snooping data can be found under the IGMP tab.

![CSSxx IGMP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-28.webp)

It is possible to enable IGMP Snooping for a specific VLAN ID under the VLANs menu.

![Css610 igmp vlantab](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-29.webp)

---

## SNMP

SwOS supports SNMP v1 and v2c (the Response for GetRequest, GetNextRequest and GetBulkRequest) and uses IF-MIB, SNMPv2-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB and MIKROTIK-MIB (only for health, PoE-out and SFP diagnostics). SNMP traps and writing SwOS configuration are not supported.

Available SNMP data:

- System information
- System uptime
- Port status
- Interface statistics
- Host table information

![Swos snmp2 1](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/swos/img/css610-30.webp)

## Reset and Reinstall

The CSS610 have built-in backup SwOS firmware which can be loaded in case standard firmware breaks or upgrade fails:

- Holding the Reset button for a few seconds while the device is booting will reset the configuration and load backup firmware.
- After loading backup firmware, it is possible to connect to 192.168.88.1 (or a leased address from a DHCP server) using a web browser and install new SwOS firmware.
