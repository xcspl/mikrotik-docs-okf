# Bridge IGMP/MLD snooping

---

IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) snooping are bridge features that enable the bridge to passively listen to IGMP/MLD network communication and use this information to make intelligent forwarding decisions for multicast traffic. By default, bridges flood all multicast traffic to every bridge port, similar to how broadcast traffic is handled. This default behavior may not be ideal for certain applications such as multicast video streaming or SDVoE (Software Defined Video over Ethernet) deployments. IGMP/MLD snooping addresses this issue by forwarding multicast traffic only to ports where interested clients are subscribed. See the IGMP/MLD network concept diagram below.

The RouterOS bridge implementation supports IGMP versions 1, 2, and 3, as well as MLD versions 1 and 2. This implementation is based on RFC4541, and the respective protocols specifications are defined in RFC1112 (IGMPv1), RFC2236 (IGMPv2), RFC3376 (IGMPv3), RFC2710 (MLDv1), and RFC3810 (MLDv2).

:::warning
Source-specific multicast forwarding is not supported for IGMPv3 and MLDv2.
:::

![IGMP Configuration Diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/img/bridge-igmp-mld-snooping-01.webp)

The bridge processes IGMP/MLD messages only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled. Additionally, the bridge must have an active IPv6 address to process MLD packets. Initially, the bridge does not restrict any multicast traffic and floods all multicast packets. Once an IGMP/MLD querier is detected—by receiving an IGMP/MLD query message (either from an external multicast router or locally from the bridge interface with `multicast-querier` enabled)—the bridge begins restricting unknown IP multicast traffic and forwards only known multicast streams from the Multicast Database (MDB). IGMP and MLD querier detection operate independently; detecting an IGMP querier does not affect IPv6 multicast forwarding, and vice versa. Querier detection also does not restrict the forwarding of non-IP and link-local multicast groups, such as 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1.

:::danger
CRS3xx series devices with Marvell-98DX3236, Marvell-98DX224S, or Marvell-98DX226S switch chips cannot distinguish between non-IP, IPv4, and IPv6 multicast packets once an IGMP or MLD querier is detected. This means the switch will stop forwarding all unknown multicast traffic (regardless of protocol) when a querier is detected. This limitation does not apply to certain link-local multicast address ranges, such as 224.0.0.0/24 or ff02::1.

## Configuration options

---

This section describes the IGMP and MLD snooping bridge configuration options.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **igmp-snooping** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables IGMP and MLD snooping. |
| **igmp-version** (*2 \| 3*; Default: **2**) | Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP querier. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **last-member-interval** (*time*; Default: **1s**) | When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes from a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the bridge will send a group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes the response time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (`last-member-interval` \* `last-member-query-count`), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).  If the bridge port is configured with fast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.  This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **last-member-query-count** (*integer: 0..4294967295*; Default: **2**) | How many times should `last-member-interval` pass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain multicast stream. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **membership-interval** (*time*; Default: **4m20s**) | The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are received on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **mld-version** (*1 \| 2*; Default: **1**) | Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an MLD querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address, `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **multicast-querier** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.  By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge generate IGMP/MLD general membership queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network. Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.  Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with the bridge interface's own IPv4 address as the source address (see `querier-uses-bridge-address`), MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring values `igmp-querier` and `mld-querier`).  This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **multicast-router** (*disabled \| permanent \| temporary-query*; Default: **temporary-query**) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge interface itself. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports and multicast traffic to the bridge interface for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`.<code>disabled</code> - disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.<code>permanent</code> - enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.<code>temporary-query</code> - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries. |
| **querier-interval** (*time*; Default: **4m15s**) | Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **querier-uses-bridge-address** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When enabled, the bridge IGMP querier uses the bridge interface's own IPv4 address as the source address for IGMP query packets instead of the default 0.0.0.0. Some multicast clients consider queries from 0.0.0.0 invalid and do not respond, which can lead to multicast stream interruptions when snooping table entries time out. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes` and the bridge interface has an IPv4 address assigned. This setting applies only to IPv4 (IGMP). MLD queries always use the IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. |
| **query-interval** (*time*; Default: **2m5s**) | Changes the interval at which IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes effect when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **query-response-interval** (*time*; Default: **10s**) | The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **startup-query-count** (*integer: 0..4294967295*; Default: **2**) | Specifies how many times general IGMP/MLD queries must be sent when the bridge interface is enabled or active querier times out. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **startup-query-interval** (*time*; Default: **31s250ms**) | Specifies the interval between startup general IGMP/MLD queries. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **fast-leave** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when an IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **multicast-router** (*disabled \| permanent \| temporary-query*; Default: **temporary-query**) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports and multicast streams to certain bridge ports for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`.<code>disabled</code> - disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.<code>permanent</code> - enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.<code>temporary-query</code> - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries. |
| **unknown-multicast-flood** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Changes the multicast flood option on the bridge port. It only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic. This includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6, and the link-local multicast ranges (e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1).  Note that when `igmp-snooping` is enabled and an IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.  When using this setting together with `igmp-snooping`, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known multicast from the MDB table. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/mdb`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*name*; Default: ) | The bridge interface to which the MDB entry is going to be assigned. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Disables or enables the static MDB entry. |
| **group** (*ipv4 \| ipv6 address*; Default: ) | The IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address. Static entries for link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 cannot be created, as these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs. |
| **ports** (*name*; Default: ) | The list of bridge ports to which the multicast group will be forwarded. |
| **vid** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: ) | The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created, only applies when `vlan-filtering` is enabled. When the VLAN ID is not specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply on all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports. |

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

---

This section describes the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge monitoring and troubleshooting options.

To monitor learned multicast database (MDB) entries, use the `print` command.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/mdb`

                             ether4            
```

To monitor the current status of a bridge interface, use the `monitor` command.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **igmp-querier** (*none*\| *interface & IPv4 address*) | Shows a bridge port and source IP address from the detected IGMP querier. Only shows the detected external IGMP querier, the local bridge IGMP querier (including IGMP proxy and PIM) will not be displayed. The monitoring value appears only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled. |
| **mld-querier** (*none*\| *interface & IPv6 address*) | Shows a bridge port and source IPv6 address from the detected MLD querier. Only shows the detected external MLD querier, the local bridge MLD querier will not be displayed. The monitoring value appears only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled and the bridge has an active IPv6 address. |
| **multicast-router** (*yes \| no*) | Shows if a multicast router is detected on the bridge interface. The monitoring value appears only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled. |

```ros

```

To monitor the current status of bridge ports, use the `monitor` command.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **multicast-router** (*yes \| no*) | Shows if a multicast router is detected on the port. Monitoring value appears only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled. |

```

## Configuration examples

---

Below are described the most common configuration examples. Some examples are using a bridge with VLAN filtering, so make sure to understand the filtering principles first - [bridge VLAN filtering](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/index.md#bridge-vlan-filtering), [bridge VLAN table](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/bridge-vlan-table.md).

### Basic IGMP snooping configuration

The first example consists only of a single IGMP snooping bridge, a single multicast source device, and a couple of multicast client devices. See a network scheme below.

![IGMP Basic Setup Diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/img/bridge-igmp-mld-snooping-02.webp)

First, create a bridge interface with enabled IGMP snooping. In this example, there is no active IGMP querier (no multicast router or proxy), so a local IGMP querier must be enabled on the same bridge. This can be done with a `multicast-querier` setting. If there is no active IGMP querier in the LAN, the unregistered IP multicast will be flooded and multicast entries will always timeout from the multicast database.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yes name=bridge1
```

Then add the necessary interfaces as bridge ports.

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
```

The basic IGMP snooping configuration is finished. Use "`/interface/bridge/mdb/print"` command to monitor the active multicast groups. If necessary, you can configure an IP address and [DHCP server](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/network-management/dhcp/server#configuration-examples) on the same bridge interface.

### IGMP snooping configuration with VLANs

The second example adds some complexity. There are two IGMP snooping bridges and we need to isolate the multicast traffic on a different VLAN. See a network scheme below.

![IGMP VLAN Setup Diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/user-guides/img/bridge-igmp-mld-snooping-03.webp)

First, create a bridge on both devices and add the needed interfaces as bridge ports. To change the untagged VLAN for a bridge port, use the `pvid` setting. Bridge1 will be acting as an IGMP querier. Below are the configuration commands for Bridge1:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yes name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=10
```

And for the Bridge2:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=10
```

:::warning
Bridge IGMP querier implementation can only send untagged IGMP queries. In case tagged IGMP queries should be sent or IGMP queries should be generated in multiple VLANs, you can configure VLAN interfaces alongside [IGMP Proxy](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/multicast/igmp-proxy.md) or [PIM-SM](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/multicast/pim-sm.md). The downstream interfaces of the IGMP Proxy, as well as PIM-SM interfaces, can operate as IGMP queriers.
:::

Make sure to configure [management access](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/#management-access-configuration) for devices. It is essential when configuring a bridge with VLAN filtering. In this example, a VLAN 99 interface with an IP address is added to the bridge. This VLAN will be allowed on the tagged sfp-sfpplus1 port. Below are configuration commands for the Bridge1:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT network=192.168.99.0
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```

And for the Bridge2:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.2/24 interface=MGMT network=192.168.99.0
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```

Add bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged and untagged ports. The VLAN 99 entry was already created when configuring management access; only VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 should be added now. Below are the configuration commands for Bridge1:

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=20
```

And for the Bridge2:

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 untagged=ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=20
```

Last, enable VLAN filtering. Below is the configuration command for Bridge1 and Bridge2:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set [find name=bridge1] vlan-filtering=yes
```

At this point, VLANs and IGMP snooping are configured and devices should be able to communicate through ports. However, it is recommended to go even a step further and apply some additional filtering options. Enable `ingress-filtering` and `frame-types` on bridge ports. Below are the configuration commands for Bridge1:

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
set [find interface=ether2] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether3] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether4] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether5] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=sfp-sfpplus1] ingress-filtering=yes
```

And for the Bridge2:

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
set [find interface=ether3] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether4] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether5] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=sfp-sfpplus1] ingress-filtering=yes
```

### Static MDB entries

Since RouterOS version 7.7, it is possible to create static MDB entries for IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups. For example, to create a static MDB entry for multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:

```ros
/interface/bridge/mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=229.10.10.10 ports=ether2,ether3 vid=10
```

Verify the results with the `print` command:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/mdb/print where group=229.10.10.10
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
 # GROUP         VID  ON-PORTS  BRIDGE 
12 229.10.10.10   10  ether2    bridge1
                      ether3   
```

In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a static MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group ff02::2 on all VLANs and ports (modify the `ports` setting for your particular setup):

```ros
/interface/bridge/mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=ff02::2 ports=bridge1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/mdb/print where group=ff02::2
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
 #   GROUP    VID  ON-PORTS  BRIDGE

16 D ff02::2   10  bridge1   bridge1
                   ether2           
                   ether3           
                   ether4           
                   ether5           
17 D ff02::2   20  bridge1   bridge1
                   ether2           
                   ether3
