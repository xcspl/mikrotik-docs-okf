# Bridging and Switching

---

![Bridge diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-01.webp)

Ethernet-like networks (Ethernet, Ethernet over IP, IEEE 802.11 in ap-bridge or bridge mode, WDS, VLAN) can be connected together using MAC bridges. The bridge feature allows the interconnection of hosts connected to separate LANs (using EoIP, geographically distributed networks can be bridged as well if any kind of IP network interconnection exists between them) as if they were attached to a single LAN. As bridges are transparent, they do not appear in the traceroute list, and no utility can make a distinction between a host working in one LAN and a host working in another LAN if these LANs are bridged. However, depending on the way the LANs are interconnected, latency and data rate between hosts may vary.

Network loops may emerge (intentionally or not) in complex topologies. Without any special treatment, loops would prevent the network from functioning normally, as they would lead to avalanche-like packet multiplication. Each bridge runs an algorithm that calculates how the loop can be prevented. (R/M)STP allows bridges to communicate with each other, so they can negotiate a loop-free topology. All other alternative connections that would otherwise form loop are put on standby, so that should the main connection fail, another connection could take its place. This algorithm exchanges configuration messages (BPDUs - Bridge Protocol Data Unit) periodically, so that all bridges are updated with the newest information about changes in the network topology. (R/M)STP selects a root bridge, which is responsible for network reconfiguration, such as blocking and opening ports on other bridges. The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest bridge ID.

## Bridge Interface Setup

---

To combine a number of networks into one bridge, a bridge interface should be created. Later, all the desired interfaces should be set up as its ports. By default, bridge MAC address will be chosen automatically, depending on the bridge port configuration. To avoid unwanted MAC address changes, it is recommended to disable `auto-mac` and manually specify the MAC address by using `admin-mac`.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **add-dhcp-option82** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: **no**) | **Important:** Starting from **RouterOS version 7.23**, this setting has been removed. Custom Remote ID and Circuit ID values can now be configured using predefined variables (such as BRIDGEMAC, HOSTNAME, INTERFACE, VID). See the `dhcp-agent-circuit-id` and `dhcp-agent-remote-id` properties below for details. If this setting was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format.   Whether to add DHCP Option 82 information (Agent Remote ID and Agent Circuit ID) to DHCP packets. Can be used together with an Option 82 capable DHCP server to assign IP addresses and implement policies. This property only has an effect when `dhcp-snooping` is set to `yes`.  In RouterOS versions 7.22 or earlier, the values are predefined and cannot be modified: For Agent Remote ID, RouterOS uses the bridge interface MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated).For Agent Circuit ID, RouterOS uses the interface name and VLAN ID separated by a colon (interface:vlan-id) where the DHCP client is connected. The VLAN ID is included only if <code>vlan-filtering</code> is enabled on the bridge. For example (`vlan-filtering=yes`):  Agent Remote ID - cc:2d:e0:01:6a:43 Agent Circuit ID - ether2:10  |
| **admin-mac** (*MAC address*; Default: **none**) | Static MAC address of the bridge. This property only has an effect when `auto-mac` is set to `no`. |
| **ageing-time** (*time*; Default: **00:05:00**) | How long a host's information will be kept in the bridge database. |
| **arp** (*disabled* \| *enabled* \| *local-proxy-arp \| proxy-arp \| reply-only*; Default: **enabled**) | Address Resolution Protocol setting<code>disabled</code> - the interface will not use ARP<code>enabled</code> - the interface will use ARP<code>local-proxy-arp</code> -  the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface<code>proxy-arp</code> - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces<code>reply-only</code> - the interface will only respond to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address combinations that are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore, for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist. |
| **arp-inspection** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables ARP inspection. When enabled, ARP packets arriving on untrusted ports are validated against the DHCP snooping binding database. Packets whose sender MAC–IP pair does not match a binding entry are dropped. On trusted ports, all ARP packets are forwarded without verification. This property only has an effect when `dhcp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **arp-timeout** (*auto \| integer*; Default: **auto**) | How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from an IP address. Value `auto` equals the value of `arp-timeout` in `/ip/settings`, default is 30s. |
| **auto-mac** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When `auto-mac=yes` is configured, the bridge will automatically select a MAC address for the bridge interface based on the following order of priority: From an Ethernet interface that is part of the bridge;From a non-Ethernet interface in the bridge (e.g., WiFi or tunnel);A randomly generated address if none of the above is available. If the configuration is changed, for example, if you add a new port to the bridge, the bridge’s MAC address will be updated only if a higher-priority address source becomes available. For example, if the bridge initially used a randomly generated MAC, then an Ethernet interface was added, the MAC would update according to the highest available priority (in this case, the Ethernet interface). The bridge will also update the MAC address if the current MAC is associated with a port that is moved to a different bridge.  The current MAC address and its priority level are saved and will be reused after a reboot.  When `auto-mac=no` is configured, you can set a static MAC address manually using the `admin-mac` property. |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Short description of the interface. |
| **dhcp-agent-circuit-id** (*string*; Default: **!dhcp-agent-circuit-id**) | Specify the **Circuit ID** suboption value of Option 82 for DHCP messages passing through the bridge. The string length is limited to 255 characters.  This setting replaces the now deprecated `add-dhcp-option82` property. If `add-dhcp-option82` was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format: $(INTERFACE):$(VID). This format will also be shown when configuring the setting through the GUI.  The following variables are supported: $(BRIDGEMAC) - current bridge MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated);$(HOSTNAME) - system identity;$(INTERFACE) - interface name where the DHCP client is connected;$(VID) - VLAN ID used by the DHCP client. If the DHCP client is untagged, the VID corresponds to the port's <code>pvid</code>.  Applies only when <code>vlan-filtering</code> is enabled on the bridge. Variable syntax rules Variables must be enclosed in parentheses and prefixed with a dollar sign ($).When configuring from the terminal, the dollar sign must be escaped with a backslash (\), otherwise it will be interpreted as a RouterOS script variable. Example:  `/interface/bridge``add add-dhcp-option82=yes dhcp-agent-circuit-id="interface: \$(INTERFACE), vlan: \$(VID)" dhcp-snooping=yes name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes`  This property has an effect only when `dhcp-snooping` is set to yes.  |
| **dhcpv6-agent-circuit-id** (*string*; Default: **!dhcpv6-agent-circuit-id**) | Specify the **Interface ID** suboption value of Option 18 for DHCPv6 messages passing through the bridge. The `dhcpv6-agent-circuit-id` property follows the same rules as `dhcp-agent-circuit-id`.  |
| **dhcp-agent-remote-id** (*string*; Default: **!dhcp-agent-remote-id**) | Specify the **Remote ID** suboption value of Option 82 for DHCP messages passing through the bridge. The string length is limited to 255 characters.  This setting replaces the now deprecated `add-dhcp-option82` property. If `add-dhcp-option82` was enabled in earlier versions (7.22 or earlier), upgrading will automatically update the configuration to the new format: $(BRIDGEMAC). This format will also be shown when configuring the setting through the GUI.  The following variables are supported: $(BRIDGEMAC) - current bridge MAC address, formatted as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (lowercase, colon-separated);$(HOSTNAME) - system identity;$(INTERFACE) - interface name where the DHCP client is connected;$(VID) - VLAN ID used by the DHCP client. If the DHCP client is untagged, the VID corresponds to the port's <code>pvid</code>.  Applies only when <code>vlan-filtering</code> is enabled on the bridge. Variable syntax rules Variables must be enclosed in parentheses and prefixed with a dollar sign ($).When configuring from the terminal, the dollar sign must be escaped with a backslash (\), otherwise it will be interpreted as a RouterOS script variable. Example:  `/interface/bridge``add add-dhcp-option82=yes dhcp-agent-remote-id="ip: 192.168.88.1, identity: \$(HOSTNAME), mac: \$(BRIDGEMAC)" dhcp-snooping=yes name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes`  This property has an effect only when `dhcp-snooping` is set to yes.  |
| **dhcpv6-agent-remote-id** (*string*; Default: **!dhcpv6-agent-remote-id**) | Specify the **Remote ID** suboption value of Option 37 for DHCPv6 messages passing through the bridge. The `dhcpv6-agent-remote-id` property follows the same rules as `dhcp-agent-remote-id`.  |
| **dhcp-snooping** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables DHCP Snooping on the bridge. **Caution:** Enabling the DHCP snooping feature will turn off bridge [fast-path](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fast-path), which in turn affects the ability to [fasttrack](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fasttrack) connections going over that bridge.  |
| **dhcpv6-snooping**(*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables DHCPv6 Snooping on the bridge. **Caution:** Enabling the DHCP snooping feature will turn off bridge [fast-path](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fast-path), which in turn affects the ability to [fasttrack](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fasttrack) connections going over that bridge.  |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Changes whether the bridge is disabled. |
| **ether-type** (*0x9100 \| 0x8100 \| 0x88a8*; Default: **0x8100**) | Changes the EtherType, which will be used to determine if a packet has a VLAN tag. Packets that have a matching EtherType are considered as tagged packets. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **fast-forward** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | A special and faster case of Fast Path which works only on bridges with 2 interfaces (enabled by default only for new bridges). More details can be found in the Fast Forward section. |
| **forward-delay** (*time*; Default: **00:00:15**) | The time which is spent during the initialization phase of the bridge interface (i.e., after router startup or enabling the interface) in the listening/learning state before the bridge will start functioning normally. |
| **forward-reserved-addresses** (*yes \| no*: Default: **no**) | Whether to forward IEEE reserved multicast MAC addresses that are in the **01:80:C2:00:00:0x** range. Bridges compliant with R/M/STP standards should refrain from forwarding these packets; this property can only be applied when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`.  Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links, using bridges as media converters, or conducting network analysis).  Here are some notable MAC addresses and protocols used by RouterOS: 01:80:C2:00:00:00 - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP);01:80:C2:00:00:01 - Ethernet Flow Control;01:80:C2:00:00:02 - Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP);01:80:C2:00:00:03 - Dot1x client and server;01:80:C2:00:00:08 - Spanning Tree Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using <code>ether-type=0x88a8</code>);01:80:C2:00:00:0D - Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using <code>ether-type=0x88a8</code>);01:80:C2:00:00:0E - Link Layer Discovery Protocol, Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group and Precision Time Protocol;**Important:** The Flow Control MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:01 is an exception; it does not get forwarded by the bridge.  |
| **frame-types** (*admit-all \| admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged \| admit-only-vlan-tagged*; Default: **admit-all**) | Specifies allowed frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **igmp-snooping** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables multicast group and port learning to prevent multicast traffic from flooding all interfaces in a bridge. |
| **igmp-version** (*2 \| 3*; Default: **2**) | Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP querier. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **ingress-filtering** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge VLAN table. By default, VLANs that don't exist in the bridge VLAN table are dropped before they are sent out (egress), but this property allows you to drop the packets when they are received (ingress). Should be used with `frame-types` to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7. |
| **ip-source-guard** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables IP Source Guard. When enabled, the bridge validates the source IP address of IPv4 packets arriving on untrusted ports against the DHCP snooping binding database. Packets whose source MAC–IP pair does not match a binding entry for the ingress port are dropped. On trusted ports, all packets are forwarded without verification. This property only has an effect when `dhcp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **l2mtu** (*read-only*; Default: ) | L2MTU indicates the maximum size of the frame without a MAC header that can be sent by this interface. The L2MTU value will be automatically set by the bridge and it will use the lowest L2MTU value of any associated bridge port. This value cannot be manually changed. |
| **last-member-interval** (*time*; Default: **1s**) | When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes from a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the bridge will send a group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes the response time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (`last-member-interval` \* `last-member-query-count`), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).  If the bridge port is configured with fast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.  This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **last-member-query-count** (*integer: 0..4294967295*; Default: **2**) | How many times should `last-member-interval` pass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain multicast stream. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **max-hops** (*integer: 6..40*; Default: **20**) | Bridge count which a BPDU can pass in an MSTP enabled network in the same region before BPDU is being ignored. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `mstp`. |
| **max-learned-entries** (*integer: 0..4294967295 \| auto \| unlimited*; Default: **auto**) | Sets the maximum number of learned hosts for the bridge interface. The default value is `auto`, and it depends on the installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default or choose the `unlimited` option, but it increases the risk of an out-of-memory condition.  The default values for certain RAM sizes: 8192 for 64 MB;16384 for 128 MB;32768 for 256 MB;65536 for 512 MB;131072 for 1024 MB or higher. This limit specifically applies to the bridge interface, not the hardware limits on the switch FDB table. Even if the bridge limit is reached, the switch can continue to learn hosts up to its hardware limits and make correct forwarding decisions. However, these additional hosts will not show up in the `/interface/bridge/host` table nor can they be monitored. Additionally, hitting this limit could impact MLAG host synchronization.  This setting has been available since RouterOS version 7.16. |
| **max-message-age** (*time: 6s..40s*; Default: **00:00:20**) | Changes the Max Age value in BPDU packets, which are transmitted by the root bridge. A root bridge sends BPDUs with Max Age set to `max-message-age` value and a Message Age of 0. Every sequential bridge will increment the Message Age before sending its BPDUs. Once a bridge receives a BPDU where Message Age is equal to or greater than Max Age, the BPDU is ignored. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `stp` or `rstp`. |
| **membership-interval** (*time*; Default: **4m20s**) | The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are received on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **mld-version** (*1 \| 2*; Default: **1**) | Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an MLD querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address, `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes`. |
| **mtu** (*integer*; Default: **auto**) | Maximum transmission unit. By default, the bridge will set MTU automatically and it will use the lowest MTU value of any associated bridge port. The default bridge MTU value without any bridge ports added is 1500. The MTU value can be set manually, but it cannot exceed the bridge L2MTU or the lowest bridge port L2MTU. If a new bridge port is added with L2MTU which is smaller than the `actual-mtu` of the bridge (set by the `mtu` property), then the manually set value will be ignored and the bridge will act as if `mtu=auto` is set.  When adding VLAN interfaces on the bridge, and when VLAN is using higher MTU than the default 1500, it is recommended to manually set the MTU of the bridge. |
| **multicast-querier** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report. Usually, a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.  By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge generate IGMP/MLD general membership queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network. Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated; the learned entries will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.  Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated. IGMP queries are sent with the bridge interface's own IPv4 address as the source address (see `querier-uses-bridge-address`), MLD queries are sent with the IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring values `igmp-querier` and `mld-querier`).  This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **multicast-router** (*disabled \| permanent \| temporary-query*; Default: **temporary-query**) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge interface itself. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to the bridge interface for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`.<code>disabled</code> - disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.<code>permanent</code> - enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.<code>temporary-query</code> - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries. |
| **name** (*text*; Default: **bridgeN**) | Name of the bridge interface. |
| **port-cost-mode** (*long \| short*; Default: **long**) | Changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic values based on interface speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configured `path-cost`  or `internal-path-cost` properties. Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate calculations for intermediate rates):  <details><summary>Path-cost table</summary>Data rateLongShort10 Mbps2,000,000100100 Mbps200,000191 Gbps20,000410 Gbps2,000225 Gbps800140 Gbps500150 Gbps4001100 Gbps2001</details> For HW offloaded bond interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied; this value remains unaffected by the total link speed of the bonding.  For virtual interfaces (such as VLAN, EoIP, VXLAN and non-HW offloaded bond), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000 is assigned for long mode, and 10 for short mode.  For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10 for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to the bridge, for instance, by using the CAPsMAN `datapath.bridge-cost` setting.  Use [port monitor](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#bridge-port-monitoring) to observe the applied path-cost.  This property has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `stp`, `rstp`, or `mstp`. |
| **priority** (*integer: 0..65535 decimal format or 0x0000-0xffff hex format*; Default: **32768 / 0x8000**) | Bridge priority, used by R/STP to determine the root bridge, used by MSTP to determine the CIST and IST regional root bridge. This property has no effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`.  **Valid values:** The bridge priority must be set in steps of 4096 (0x1000). The 12 lowest bits are ignored. Valid values are: 0x0000, 0x1000, 0x2000, 0x3000, 0x4000, 0x5000, 0x6000, 0x7000, 0x8000, 0x9000, 0xa000, 0xb000, 0xc000, 0xd000, 0xe000, 0xf000 (or their decimal equivalents: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, 61440). |
| **protocol-mode** (*none \| rstp \| stp \| mstp*; Default: **rstp**) | Select Spanning tree protocol (STP) or Rapid spanning tree protocol (RSTP) to ensure a loop-free topology for any bridged LAN. RSTP provides a faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change. Select MSTP to ensure loop-free topology across multiple VLANs.  The forwarding of reserved MAC addresses that are in the **01:80:C2:00:00:0x** range is separated from `protocol-mode=none`, and is now available as a controllable property `forward-reserved-addresses` since RouterOS v7.16. |
| **pvid** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **1**) | Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. It applies e.g. to frames sent from bridge IP and destined to a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **querier-interval** (*time*; Default: **4m15s**) | Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **querier-uses-bridge-address** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When enabled, the bridge IGMP querier uses the bridge interface's own IPv4 address as the source address for IGMP query packets instead of the default 0.0.0.0. Some multicast clients consider queries from 0.0.0.0 invalid and do not respond, which can lead to multicast stream interruptions when snooping table entries time out. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` are set to `yes` and the bridge interface has an IPv4 address assigned. This setting applies only to IPv4 (IGMP). MLD queries always use the IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. |
| **query-interval** (*time*; Default: **2m5s**) | Changes the interval at which IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes place when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` is set to `yes`. |
| **query-response-interval** (*time*; Default: **10s**) | The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is active as an IGMP/MLD querier. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` is set to `yes`. |
| **region-name** (*text*; Default: ) | MSTP region name. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `mstp`. |
| **region-revision** (*integer: 0..65535*; Default: **0**) | MSTP configuration revision number. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `mstp`. |
| **ra-guard** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | RA guard - a security feature that validates incoming Router Advertisements against a list of authorized, trusted ports. |
| **startup-query-count** (*integer: 0..4294967295*; Default: **2**) | Specifies how many times general IGMP/MLD queries must be sent when the bridge interface is enabled or the active querier times out. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` is set to `yes`. |
| **startup-query-interval** (*time*; Default: **31s250ms**) | Specifies the interval between startup general IGMP/MLD queries. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` and `multicast-querier` is set to `yes`. |
| **transmit-hold-count** (*integer: 1..10*; Default: **6**) | The Transmit Hold Count used by the Port Transmit state machine to limit the transmission rate. |
| **vlan-filtering** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Globally enables or disables VLAN functionality for the bridge. |

:::danger
Changing certain properties can cause the bridge to temporarily disable all ports. This must be taken into account whenever changing such properties on production environments since it can cause all packets to be temporarily dropped. Such properties include `vlan-filtering`, `protocol-mode`, `igmp-snooping`, `fast-forward` and others.

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to create and verify a basic bridge interface for simple Layer 2 switching. This configuration creates a bridge that combines multiple Ethernet ports into a single switched network segment.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/add
[admin@MikroTik] > interface bridge print 
Flags: X - disabled, R - running 
0 R name="bridge1" mtu=auto actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=65535 arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto mac-address=5E:D2:42:95:56:7F protocol-mode=rstp fast-forward=yes 
igmp-snooping=no auto-mac=yes ageing-time=5m priority=0x8000 max-message-age=20s forward-delay=15s transmit-hold-count=6 vlan-filtering=no 
dhcp-snooping=no 
```

### Bridge Monitoring

To monitor the current status of a bridge interface, use the `monitor` command.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/monitor`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge-id** (*priority.MAC address*) | Local bridge identifier, which is in the form of bridge-priority.bridge-MAC-address. |

## Spanning Tree Protocol

---

RouterOS bridge interfaces are capable of running Spanning Tree Protocol to ensure a loop-free and redundant topology. For small networks with just 2 bridges, STP does not bring many benefits, but for larger networks, properly configured STP is very crucial, leaving STP-related values at default may result in a completely unreachable network in case of even a single bridge failure. To achieve a proper loop-free and redundant topology, it is necessary to properly set bridge priorities, port path costs, and port priorities.

:::danger
In RouterOS it is possible to set any value for bridge priority between 0 and 65535, the IEEE 802.1W standard states that the bridge priority must be in steps of 4096. This can cause incompatibility issues between devices that do not support such values. To avoid compatibility issues, it is recommended to use only these priorities: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, 61440
:::

STP has multiple variants; currently, RouterOS supports STP, RSTP, and MSTP. Depending on needs, either one of them can be used; some devices are able to run some of these protocols using hardware offloading; detailed information about which devices support it can be found in the Hardware Offloading section. STP is considered to be outdated and slow; it has been almost entirely replaced in all network topologies by RSTP, which is backward compatible with STP. For network topologies that depend on VLANs, it is recommended to use MSTP since it is a VLAN-aware protocol and gives the ability to do load balancing per VLAN groups. There are a lot of considerations that should be made when designing an STP-enabled network, more detailed case studies can be found in the [Spanning Tree Protocol](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/spanning-tree-protocol.md) article. In RouterOS, the `protocol-mode` property controls the used STP variant.

:::info
RouterOS bridge does not work with PVST and its variants. The PVST BPDUs (with a MAC destination 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CD) are treated by RouterOS bridges as typical multicast packets. In simpler terms, they undergo RouterOS bridge/switch forwarding logic and may get tagged or untagged.
:::

:::info
By the IEEE 802.1ad standard, the BPDUs from bridges that comply with IEEE 802.1Q are not compatible with IEEE 802.1ad bridges. This means that the same bridge VLAN protocol should be used across all bridges in a single Layer2 domain; otherwise (R/M)STP will not function properly.
:::

### Per-port STP

There might be certain situations where you want to limit STP functionality on a single port or multiple ports. Below you can find examples for different use cases.

:::danger
Be careful when changing the default (R/M)STP functionality; make sure you understand the working principles of STP and BPDUs. Misconfigured (R/M)STP can cause unexpected behavior.
:::

#### Create Edge Ports and Enable BPDU Guard

Edge ports connect to end devices that do not participate in STP, such as workstations or routers. Setting `edge=yes` allows the port to skip the STP listening and learning states and transition directly to the forwarding state. To protect the network from an unauthorized bridge or switch connected to an edge port, also enable `bpdu-guard=yes`.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 edge=yes bpdu-guard=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```

When a protected port receives a BPDU, the bridge port becomes inactive and the following log entry is added:

```text
2026-09-21 13:46:30 bridge,stp,warning bpdu-guard disabling ether1 due to received bpdu
```

The port remains inactive until it is manually re-enabled. Print the bridge port table to view the `I` (inactive) flag and the explanatory BPDU Guard comment:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/print
Flags: I - INACTIVE; H - HW-OFFLOAD
Columns: INTERFACE, BRIDGE, HW, HORIZON, TRUSTED, TRUSTED-RA, TRUSTED-DHCPV6, TRUSTED-ARP, FAST-LEAVE, BPDU-GUARD, EDGE, POINT-TO-POINT, PVID, FRAME-TYPES
#    INTERFACE  BRIDGE   HW   HORIZON  TRUSTED  TRUSTED-RA  TRUSTED-DHCPV6  TRUSTED-ARP  FAST-LEAVE  BPDU-GUARD  EDGE  POINT-TO-POINT  PVID  FRAME-TYPES
;;; BPDU guard changed port role to disabled due to received BPDU frame, manual bridge port re-enable is required
0 IH ether1     bridge1  yes  none     no       no          no              no           no          yes         yes   auto               1  admit-all
1  H ether2     bridge1  yes  none     no       no          no              no           no          no          auto  auto               1  admit-all
```

Remove the unauthorized bridge or correct the BPDU source first. After the port is re-enabled, the inactive flag and BPDU Guard comment are cleared:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/disable [find interface=ether1]
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/enable [find interface=ether1]
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/print
Flags: H - HW-OFFLOAD
Columns: INTERFACE, BRIDGE, HW, HORIZON, TRUSTED, TRUSTED-RA, TRUSTED-DHCPV6, TRUSTED-ARP, FAST-LEAVE, BPDU-GUARD, EDGE, POINT-TO-POINT, PVID, FRAME-TYPES
#   INTERFACE  BRIDGE   HW   HORIZON  TRUSTED  TRUSTED-RA  TRUSTED-DHCPV6  TRUSTED-ARP  FAST-LEAVE  BPDU-GUARD  EDGE  POINT-TO-POINT  PVID  FRAME-TYPES
0 H ether1     bridge1  yes  none     no       no          no              no           no          yes         yes   auto               1  admit-all
1 H ether2     bridge1  yes  none     no       no          no              no           no          no          auto  auto               1  admit-all
```

#### Enable Root Guard

Root Guard is a spanning tree security feature that prevents a port from becoming the root port, thereby protecting the active spanning tree topology from being influenced by external bridges. In this example, **ether1** is configured with `restricted-role=yes`. This setting prevents the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (in discarding state) and will remain in that state as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 restricted-role=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/monitor [find]

## Bridge Settings

---

Under the bridge settings menu, it is possible to control certain features for all bridge interfaces and monitor global bridge counters.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/settings`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **use-ip-firewall** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Direct bridged traffic to [IP/IPv6 firewall](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/firewall/index.md) (prerouting, forward, and postrouting sections of IP/IPv6 routing, see more details on [Packet Flow](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#flow-of-bridged-packet) article). Below are some use cases when this setting can be enabled to accomplish certain tasks: In case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Tree for traffic flowing through bridged ports.In case you want to use IP/IPv6 firewall capabilities for traffic flowing through bridged ports, which would normally bypass IP/IPv6 firewall.**Caution:** Enabling the `use-ip-firewall` feature will turn off bridge [Fast Path](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fast-path), which in turn affects the ability to [fasttrack](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fasttrack) connections going over that bridge. And because this setting introduces additional processing steps (prerouting, forward and postrouting chains), it will increase CPU usage even more when forwarding packets.  **Routed traffic**, including traffic from VLAN interfaces (e.g., `/interface/vlan` created on the bridge), **is already processed by the IP firewall**. In such cases, enabling this setting has no additional effect.  |
| **use-ip-firewall-for-pppoe** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Direct bridged un-encrypted PPPoE encapsulated traffic to IP/IPv6 firewall. This property only has an effect when `use-ip-firewall` is set to `yes`. |
| **use-ip-firewall-for-vlan** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Direct bridged VLAN tagged traffic to IP/IPv6 firewall. This property only has an effect when `use-ip-firewall` is set to `yes`.  If you need to use the IP/IPv6 firewall and bridge `vlan-filtering` is enabled (which involves VLAN tag handling), then you should also enable `use-ip-firewall-for-vlan=yes`.  When this setting is enabled and packets are routed between VLAN interfaces (e.g., `/interface/vlan`), the `in-interface` in the IP firewall's **prerouting** chain will match the bridge interface instead of the individual VLAN interface. |
| **allow-fast-path** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Whether to enable a bridge Fast Path globally. |
| **bridge-fast-path-active** (*yes \| no*; Default: *)* | Shows whether a bridge Fast Path is active globally. Fast Path status per bridge interface is not displayed. |
| **bridge-fast-path-packets** (*integer*; Default: *)* | Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Path. |
| **bridge-fast-path-bytes** (*integer*; Default: *)* | Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Path. |
| **bridge-fast-forward-packets** (*integer*; Default: *)* | Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward. |
| **bridge-fast-forward-bytes** (*integer*; Default: *)* | Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward. |

:::warning
In case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees to traffic that is being forwarded by a bridge, then you need to enable the `use-ip-firewall` property. Without using this property the bridge traffic will never reach the postrouting chain. Simple Queues and global Queue Trees are working in the postrouting chain. To assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees for VLAN or PPPoE traffic in a bridge you should enable the appropriate properties as well.
:::

## Port Settings

---

The Port submenu is used to add interfaces in a particular bridge.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **auto-isolate** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | When enabled, it prevents a port from moving from discarding state into forwarding state if no BPDUs are received from the neighboring bridge. The port will change into a forwarding state only when a BPDU is received. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `rstp` or `mstp` and `edge` is set to `no`. |
| **bpdu-guard** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables the BPDU Guard feature on a port. This feature puts the port in a disabled role if it receives a BPDU and requires the port to be manually disabled and enabled if a BPDU is received. It should be used to prevent a bridge from BPDU-related attacks. This property has no effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`. |
| **bridge** (*name*; Default: **none**) | The bridge interface where the respective interface is grouped. |
| **broadcast-flood** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When enabled, the bridge floods broadcast traffic to all bridge egress ports. When disabled, the bridge drops broadcast traffic on egress ports. It can be used to filter all broadcast traffic on an egress port. Broadcast traffic is considered as traffic that uses **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF** as the destination MAC address. Such traffic is crucial for many protocols such as DHCP, ARP, NDP, BOOTP (Netinstall), and others. This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU. |
| **edge** (*auto \| no \| no-discover \| yes \| yes-discover*; Default: **auto**) | Set a port as an edge port or a non-edge port, or enable edge discovery. Edge ports are connected to a LAN that has no other bridges attached. An edge port will skip the learning and the listening states in STP and will transition directly to the forwarding state. This reduces the STP initialization time. If the port is configured to discover an edge port, then as soon as the bridge detects a BPDU coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port. This property has no effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`.<code>no</code> - non-edge port with disabled discovery. It will participate in learning and listening states in STP. It will not transition to the forwarding state until it exchanges BPDUs and reaches agreement with the connected bridge. If no BPDU is received, the port may remain in a non-forwarding state indefinitely.<code>no-discover</code> - non-edge port with enabled discovery. It will participate in learning and listening states in STP. A port can become an edge port if no BPDU is received.<code>yes</code> - edge port without discovery. It will transition directly to forwarding state.<code>yes-discover</code> - edge port with enabled discovery. It will transition directly to forwarding state.<code>auto</code> - same as <code>no-discover</code>, but will additionally detect if a bridge port is a Wireless interface with disabled bridge-mode. Such an interface will be automatically set as an edge port without discovery. |
| **fast-leave** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables the IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when an IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **frame-types** (*admit-all \| admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged \| admit-only-vlan-tagged*; Default: **admit-all**) | Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **ingress-filtering** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge VLAN table. Should be used with `frame-types` to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7. |
| **learn** (*auto \| no \| yes*; Default: **auto**) | Changes MAC learning behavior on a bridge port<code>yes</code> - enables MAC learning<code>no</code> - disables MAC learning<code>auto</code> - detects if the bridge port is a Wireless interface and uses a Wireless registration table instead of MAC learning, will use the Wireless registration table if the Wireless interface is set to one of <code>ap-bridge</code>, <code>bridge</code>, <code>wds-slave</code> mode and bridge mode for the Wireless interface is disabled. |
| **multicast-router** (*disabled \| permanent \| temporary-query*; Default: **temporary-query**) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to certain bridge ports for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when `igmp-snooping` is set to `yes`.<code>disabled</code> - disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.<code>permanent</code> - enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.<code>temporary-query</code> - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries. |
| **horizon** (*integer 0..429496729*; Default: **none**) | Use split horizon bridging to prevent bridging loops. Set the same value for a group of ports, to prevent them from sending data to ports with the same horizon value. Split horizon is a software feature that disables hardware offloading. |
| **hw** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Allows enabling or disabling [hardware offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#bridge-hardware-offloading) on interfaces capable of HW offloading. For software interfaces like [EoIP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/virtual-private-networks/eoip.md) or [VLAN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/vlan.md), this setting is ignored and has no effect. Certain bridge or port functions can automatically disable HW offloading, use the `print` command to see whether the "H" flag is active. |
| **internal-path-cost** (*integer: 1..200000000*; Default: ) | Path cost to the interface for MSTI0 inside a region. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the internal-path-cost based on the interface speed and the `port-cost-mode` setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before the `internal-path-cost` property. This property only has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `mstp`.  `/interface/bridge/port/set [find interface=sfp28-1] !internal-path-cost`  Use [port monitor](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#bridge-port-monitoring) to observe the applied internal-path-cost.  |
| **interface** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Name of the interface or interface list. |
| **path-cost** (*integer: 1..200000000*; Default: ) | Path cost to the interface, used by STP and RSTP to determine the best path, and used by MSTP to determine the best path between regions. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the path-cost based on the interface speed and the `port-cost-mode` setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before the `path-cost` property. This property has no effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`.  `/interface/bridge/port/set [find interface=sfp28-1] !path-cost`  Use [port monitor](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#bridge-port-monitoring) to observe the applied path-cost.  |
| **point-to-point** (*auto \| yes \| no*; Default: **auto**) | Specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of failure. By setting this property to `yes`, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and waits for BPDUs from other devices on this single link. By setting this property to `no`, you are expecting that a link can receive BPDUs from multiple devices. By setting the property to `yes`, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In general, you should only set this property to `no` if it is possible that another device can be connected to a link. This is mostly relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex, `auto` enables point-to-point functionality. This property has no effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `none`. |
| **priority** (*0x00 \| 0x10 \| 0x20 \| 0x30 \| 0x40 \| 0x50 \| 0x60 \| 0x70 \| 0x80 \| 0x90 \| 0xa0 \| 0xb0 \| 0xc0 \| 0xd0 \| 0xe0 \| 0xf0*; Default: **0x80**) | The priority of the interface, used by STP to determine the root port, used by MSTP to determine the root port between regions. Must be set in steps of 16 (0x10). |
| **pvid** (*integer 1..4094*; Default: **1**) | Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **restricted-role** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables the restricted role on a port. When enabled, it prevents the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree, a feature also known as root-guard or root-protection. This property has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `stp`, `rstp`, or `mstp` (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14). |
| **restricted-tcn** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables topology change notification (TCN) handling on a port. When enabled, it causes the port not to propagate received topology change notifications to other ports, and any changes caused by the port itself do not result in topology change notification to other ports. This parameter is disabled by default. It can be set by a network administrator to prevent external bridges from causing MAC address flushing in the local network. This property has an effect when `protocol-mode` is set to `stp`, `rstp`, or `mstp` (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14). |
| **tag-stacking** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on the ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN tag regardless of whether a VLAN tag already exists. Packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the `pvid`value and will use EtherType that is specified in `ether-type`. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **trusted** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCP packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to prevent unauthorized servers from providing malicious information for users. This property only has an effect when `dhcp-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **trusted-arp** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | When enabled, ARP packets arriving on this port are forwarded without validation against the DHCP snooping binding database. When disabled, ARP packets arriving on this port are validated against the DHCP snooping binding database and packets whose sender MAC–IP pair does not match a binding entry are dropped. This property only has an effect when `arp-inspection` is set to `yes`. |
| **trusted-dhcpv6** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCPv6 packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to prevent unauthorized servers from providing malicious information for users. This property only has an effect when `dhcpv6-snooping` is set to `yes`. |
| **trusted-ra** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Specifies whether the port is permitted to forward IPv6 Router Advertisement messages; set to **yes** for ports connected to legitimate routers and **no** to block unauthorized sources. This property only has an effect when `ra-guard` is set to `yes`. |
| **unknown-multicast-flood** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Changes the multicast flood option on the bridge port and only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic. This includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1).  Note that when `igmp-snooping` is enabled and an IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.  When using this setting together with `igmp-snooping`, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known multicast from the MDB table. |
| **unknown-unicast-flood** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Changes the unknown unicast flood option on the bridge port and only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding unknown unicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts unknown unicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port.  If a MAC address is not learned in the host table, then the traffic is considered unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all ports. MAC address is learned as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received and the source MAC address is added to the bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learned. |

:::info
RouterOS can handle a maximum of 1024 bridged interfaces per bridge; this limit is fixed and cannot be modified. If you try to add more interfaces as bridge ports, it may lead to unpredictable behavior.

### Example

This example demonstrates how to add Ethernet ports to an existing bridge interface to create a simple Layer 2 switching setup. By adding **ether1** and **ether2** to **bridge1**, these physical ports become part of a single switched network segment, allowing devices connected to either port to communicate with each other as if they were on the same LAN.

First, add each port to the bridge interface:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```

Verify the configuration by displaying the bridge port table:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload 
 #     INTERFACE       BRIDGE       HW  PVID PRIORITY  PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST    HORIZON
 0     ether1          bridge1      yes  100     0x80         10                 10       none
 1     ether2          bridge1      yes  200     0x80         10                 10       none
```

The output confirms both ports are now bridged together. The **H** flag indicates that hardware offloading is active, meaning the switch chip is handling packet forwarding for optimal performance. Each port is assigned a default PVID (Port VLAN ID) of 100 and 200 respectively, and both use the standard STP priority of 0x80.

### Interface Lists

Starting with RouterOS v6.41, interface lists can be added as bridge ports and sorted. Interface lists simplify firewall rule configuration by grouping multiple interfaces together. The following example demonstrates how to add an interface list to a bridge:

```ros
/interface/list
add name=LAN1
add name=LAN2
/interface/list/member
add interface=ether1 list=LAN1
add interface=ether2 list=LAN1
add interface=ether3 list=LAN2
add interface=ether4 list=LAN2
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN2
```

When interface lists are added to a bridge, the individual ports from those lists appear as dynamic ports entries:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port> pr
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload 
 #     INTERFACE       BRIDGE       HW  PVID PRIORITY  PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST    HORIZON
 0     LAN1            bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 1  D  ether1          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 2  D  ether2          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 3     LAN2            bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 4  D  ether3          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 5  D  ether4          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
```

The order in which interface lists appear can be rearranged using the `move` command. The second parameter specifies the position before which the selected interface list should be placed. The following example demonstrates how to sort interface lists:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/port/move 3 0
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/port/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload 
 #     INTERFACE       BRIDGE       HW  PVID PRIORITY  PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST    HORIZON
 0     LAN2            bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 1  D  ether3          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 2  D  ether4          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 3     LAN1            bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 4  D  ether1          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 5  D  ether2          bridge1      yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
```

:::warning
When using the `move` command, the second parameter represents the "before id" position, which determines where the selected interface list will be moved. If the first interface list is moved to the position of the second interface list, the command has no effect since the first list would already be positioned before the second list.
:::

### Interface Lists in VLAN Table

Starting from RouterOS version 7.17, you can use interface lists for the `tagged` and `untagged` properties in the bridge VLAN table. This enhancement allows for more flexible VLAN assignment to ports by simply modifying the interface list members, rather than updating each bridge VLAN entry individually.

If different interface lists are specified for the `tagged` and `untagged` settings, and there is overlap between the interface members, the `untagged` list takes priority. You can check the current interface configuration using the `current-tagged` and `current-untagged` properties with the `print` command.

The following example demonstrates how new interfaces can be added to existing interface lists, automatically updating the bridge port and VLAN table without directly modifying settings in those menus:

```ros
/interface/list
add name=vlan10_untagged
add name=vlan20_untagged
add name=vlan_tagged
/interface/list/member
add interface=ether2 list=vlan10_untagged
add interface=ether3 list=vlan10_untagged
add interface=ether4 list=vlan20_untagged
add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 list=vlan_tagged
/interface/bridge
add frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=vlan10_untagged pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=vlan20_untagged pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged interface=vlan_tagged
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=vlan_tagged vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=vlan_tagged vlan-ids=20

### Bridge Port Monitoring

To monitor the current status of bridge ports, use the `monitor` command.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port/monitor`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **actual-path-cost** (*integer: 1..200000000*) | Shows the actual port path-cost. Either manually applied or automatically determined based on the interface speed and the `port-cost-mode` setting. |
| **declared-vlan-ids** (*integer 1..4094*) | VLANs declared by the interface via [MVRP Protocol](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#mvrp). |
| **designated-bridge-id** (*priority.MAC address*) | Shows the designated bridge identifier, as determined from the port's priority vector. |
| **designated-cost** (*integer*) | Shows the designated root-path-cost, as determined from the port's priority vector. |
| **designated-internal-cost** (*integer*) | Shows the designated internal-root-path-cost, as determined from the port's priority vector. |
| **designated-message-age**(*time)* | Shows the designated message age, as determined from the port's priority vector. |
| **designated-max-age** (*time)* | Shows the designated max age, as determined from the port's priority vector. The BPDU packet can pass as many bridges as specified in the `max-message-age` parameter. |
| **designated-port-id** (*priority*.*integer*) | Shows the designated port identifier, as determined from the port's priority vector. |
| **designated-remaining-hops** (*integer*) | Shows the designated remaining hops, as determined from the port's priority vector. Number of hops that a packet is allowed to traverse before reaching its destination. |
| **discard-transitions** (*integer*) | Counter, registering how often port transitions into discarding state. |
| **edge-port** (*yes \| no*) | Whether the port is an edge port or not. |
| **edge-port-discovery** (*yes \| no*) | Whether the port is set to automatically detect edge ports. |
| **external-fdb** (*yes \| no*) | Whether the registration table is used instead of a forwarding database. |
| **forwarding** (*yes \| no*) | Shows if the port is not blocked by (R/M)STP. |
| **forward-transitions** (*integer*) | Counter, registering how often port transitions into forwarding state |
| **hw-offload-group** (*switchX*) | Switch chip used by the port. |
| **interface** (*name*) | Interface name. |
| **last-topology-change** (*time)* | Last topology change timer, records time since the last change. |
| **learning** (*yes \| no*) | Shows whether the port is capable of learning MAC addresses. |
| **multicast-router** (*yes \| no*) | Shows if a multicast router is detected on the port. Monitoring value appears only when `igmp-snooping` is enabled. |
| **registered-vlan-ids** (*integer 1..4094*) | VLANs where the interface is registered via [MVRP Protocol](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#mvrp). |
| **port-id** (*priority*.*integer*) | In Spanning Tree Protocol each port has a unique Port Identifier. Priority[hex] + port number. |
| **point-to-point-port** (*yes \| no*) | Whether the port is connected to a bridge port using full-duplex (yes) or half-duplex (no). |
| **role** (*designated \| root-port \| alternate \| backup \| disabled*) | (R/M)STP algorithm assigned port role: <code>disabled-port</code> - disabled or inactive port.<code>root-port</code> - port that is facing towards the root bridge and has the best (lowest cost) path to the root bridge. Only one root port is elected per bridge (except the root bridge itself).<code>alternative-port</code> - port that is facing towards the root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic. Port provides a backup path to the root bridge if the current root port fails.<code>designated-port</code> - port that is facing away from the root bridge and forwards traffic away from the root bridge to downstream devices.<code>backup-port</code> - port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is going to forward traffic. Port that serves as a backup for a designated port on the same segment. In RouterOS, the **role** monitoring property displays RSTP roles, such as `alternate-port` and `backup-port`, even when STP mode is enabled. While this is technically incorrect, it does not affect the operation of STP. This is because STP treats all blocked ports the same, without differentiating their purpose (e.g., as potential backup paths). The displayed roles are simply a reflection of RSTP functionality and have no practical impact when STP is in use. See more details on [STP and RSTP page](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/spanning-tree-protocol.md#stp-and-rstp). |
| **root-path-cost** (*integer*) | The total cost of the path to the root-bridge. |
| **sending-rstp** (*yes \| no*) | Whether the port is using RSTP or MSTP BPDU types. A port will transit to STP type when RSTP/MSTP enabled port receives an STP BPDU. This setting **does not** indicate whether the BPDUs are actually sent. |
| **status** (*in-bridge \| inactive*) | Port status:<code>in-bridge</code> - port is enabled<code>inactive</code> - port is disabled. |
| **tx-rx-bpdu** (*integer*) | Sent/received bpdu messages counter. |
| **tx-rx-tc** (*integer*) | Topology change messages transmitted/received. |
| **topology-changes** (*integer*) | Topology change counter. |

The hosts table displays MAC addresses that have been learned on a bridge interface. This table also shows various flags that provide additional information about each host entry. Access the hosts table through the `/interface/bridge/host` submenu.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/host`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*read-only: name*) | The bridge to which the host entry belongs |
| **disabled** (*read-only: flag*) | Indicates whether the static host entry is disabled |
| **dynamic** (*read-only: flag*) | Indicates whether the host was dynamically learned |
| **external** (*read-only: flag*) | Indicates whether the host was learned from an external table, such as a switch chip or Wireless registration table. Static host entries added on hardware-offloaded bridge ports do not display this flag |
| **invalid** (*read-only: flag*) | Indicates whether the host entry is invalid. This flag may appear for statically configured hosts on an interface that has been removed |
| **local** (*read-only: flag*) | Indicates whether the host entry was created from the bridge itself, which displays all local interfaces |
| **mac-address** (*read-only: MAC address*) | The MAC address of the host |
| **on-interface** (*read-only: name*) | The bridge port to which the host is connected |

### Monitoring

To view the active hosts table, use the `print` command. The table displays all MAC addresses that have been learned on the bridge interface, along with flags indicators and connection details.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/host/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - external 
 #       MAC-ADDRESS        VID ON-INTERFACE            BRIDGE
0   D   B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7      ether1                  bridge1
1   D   B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D8      ether2                  bridge1
2   DL  CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:38      bridge1                 bridge1
3   DL  CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:39      ether2                  bridge1
```

The output shows:

- **D** flag: Dynamically learned MAC addresses
- **DL** flag: Local interface MAC addresses (the bridge itself and its ports interfaces)
- **VID**: VLAN ID associated with the host entry
- **ON-INTERFACE**: The bridge port where the host was learned
- **BRIDGE**: The bridge interface the host belongs to

### Static Entries

The bridge host table supports static MAC address entries configuration. Static entries is useful in two primary scenarios: directing specific traffic through a designated port, and securing device resources by disabling dynamic MAC learning while relying solely on pre-configured static entries.

The following table lists all configurable parameters for static MAC address entries:

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/host`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*name*; Default: **none**) | The bridge interface to which the MAC address is assigned. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables the static MAC address entry. |
| **interface** (*name*; Default: **none**) | Name of the interface where the MAC address traffic is forwarded. |
| **mac-address** (*MAC address*; Default: ) | The MAC address to be added to the host table statically. |
| **vid** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: ) | VLAN ID associated with the static MAC address entry. |

**Example:** To forward all traffic destined for MAC address **4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43** exclusively through **ether2**, use the following command:

```ros
/interface/bridge/host
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43
```

## Multicast Table

---

The Multicast Table displays multicast group membership information learned through IGMP/MLD snooping. When IGMP/MLD snooping is enabled on a bridge, the device actively monitors IGMP/MLD network communications to build a Multicast Database (MDB) of active multicast groups and their subscribed ports members. The bridge then uses this information to intelligently forward multicast traffic only to ports where interested receivers devices are connected, rather than flooding all ports with multicast traffic.

Note that packets addressed to link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 are exceptions to this behavior - these addresses are always flooded to all ports and VLANs without restriction, as they are used for network protocol operations.

To view the current multicast database entries table, use the `print` command in the multicast database submenu.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/mdb`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*read-only: name*) | Shows the bridge interface the entry belongs to. |
| **group** (*read-only:*ipv4 | ipv6 | MAC address*) | Shows a multicast group address. |
| **on-interface** (*read-only: name*) | Shows the bridge ports which are subscribed to the multicast group. |
| **vid** (*read-only: integer*) | Shows the VLAN ID for the multicast group, only applies when `vlan-filtering` is enabled. |

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/mdb/print 
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
 #   GROUP              VID  ON-PORTS  BRIDGE 
 0 D ff02::2              1  bridge1   bridge1
 1 D ff02::6a             1  bridge1   bridge1
 2 D ff02::1:ff00:0       1  bridge1   bridge1
 3 D ff02::1:ff01:6a43    1  bridge1   bridge1
 4 D 229.1.1.1           10  ether2    bridge1
 5 D 229.2.2.2           10  ether3    bridge1
                             ether2           
 6 D ff02::2             10  ether5    bridge1
                             ether3           
                             ether2           
                             ether4           
```

### Static entries

Since RouterOS version 7.7, it is possible to create static MDB entries for IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/mdb`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*name*; Default: ) | The bridge interface to which the MDB entry is going to be assigned. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Disables or enables the static MDB entry. |
| **group** (*ipv4 \| ipv6 \| MAC address*; Default: ) | The IPv4, IPv6 or MAC multicast address. Static entries for link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 cannot be created, as these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs. |
| **interface** (*name*; Default: ) | The list of bridge ports to which the multicast group will be forwarded. |
| **vid** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: ) | The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created only applies when `vlan-filtering` is enabled. When VLAN ID is not specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply to all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports. |

For example, to create a static MDB entry for multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:

```ros
/interface/bridge/mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=229.10.10.10 interface=ether2,ether3 vid=10
```

Verify the results with the `print` command:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/mdb/print where group=229.10.10.10
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
 # GROUP         VID  ON-PORTS  BRIDGE 
12 229.10.10.10   10  ether2    bridge1
                      ether3   
```

In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired for it to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a static MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group ff02::2 on all VLANs and ports (modify the `ports` setting for your particular setup):

```ros
/interface/bridge/mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=ff02::2 interface=bridge1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/mdb/print where group=ff02::2
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
 #   GROUP    VID  ON-PORTS  BRIDGE 
 0   ff02::2                 bridge1
15 D ff02::2    1  bridge1   bridge1
16 D ff02::2   10  bridge1   bridge1
                   ether2           
                   ether3           
                   ether4           
                   ether5           
17 D ff02::2   20  bridge1   bridge1
                   ether2           
                   ether3           
18 D ff02::2   30  bridge1   bridge1
                   ether2           
                   ether3     
```

## Bridge Hardware Offloading

---

It is possible to switch multiple ports together if a device has a built-in switch chip. While a bridge is a software feature that will consume CPU's resources, the bridge hardware offloading will allow you to use the built-in switch chip to forward packets at wire speed. This allows you to achieve higher throughput if configured correctly.

![HWoffloading_diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-02.webp)

A packet that is received by one of the ports always passes through the switch logic first. Switch logic decides which ports the packet should be going to - usually based on the destination MAC address. Hardware-forwarded packets will not be visible to RouterOS (only statistics will show that a packet has passed through). This is because the packet was already processed by the switch chip and never reached the CPU.

Packets can be forwarded to the CPU via the switch CPU port for management access, routing, firewall rules, or traffic control. This requires configuration specific to your device and use case. Check the manual page for your specific device:

- [Marvell Prestera switch chip features](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/marvell-prestera-switch-chip-features.md)
- [CRS1xx/2xx series switches](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/crs1xx-2xx-series-switches-examples.md)
- [Non-CRS series switches](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/switch-chip-features.md)

:::danger
Certain bridge and Ethernet port properties are directly related to switch chip settings. Changing such properties can trigger a **switch chip reset**, temporarily disabling all Ethernet ports. This must be taken into account whenever changing properties in production environments. Such properties include DHCP Snooping, IGMP Snooping, VLAN filtering, L2MTU, Flow Control, and others. The exact settings that can trigger a switch chip reset depend on the device's model.
:::

:::warning
[CRS1xx/2xx series switches](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/crs1xx-2xx-series-switches-examples#multiple-switch-groups) support multiple hardware offloaded bridges per switch chip. All other devices support only one. Use `hw=yes/no` under `/interface/bridge/port` to select which bridge uses hardware offloading.
:::

The following tables list which bridge features are supported with hardware offloading (✓) or disable hardware offloading (✗) for each switch chip type:

:::danger
Using `protocol-mode=none` on **IPQ-PPE** enables HW offloaded bridge and can cause issues.  
It is recommended to use a non-HW offloaded bridge by keeping the default `protocol-mode=rstp` setting or by manually setting `hw=no` under `/interface/bridge/port`.
:::

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure port switching using a bridge with hardware offloading enabled. This configuration creates a bridge interface and adds multiple Ethernet interfaces as bridge ports. The `hw=yes` bridge port setting is used by default.

```ros
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
```

Verify that hardware offloading is active by checking the **H** flag in the bridge port table:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/port/print 
Flags: H - HW-OFFLOAD
Columns: INTERFACE, BRIDGE, HW, HORIZON, TRUSTED, TRUSTED-RA, TRUSTED-DHCPV6, FAST-LEAVE, BPDU-GUARD, EDGE, POINT-TO-POINT, PVID, FRAME-TYPES

```

## Bridge VLAN Filtering

---

Bridge VLAN Filtering enables VLAN-aware Layer 2 forwarding and allows VLAN tag modification within the bridge. This feature makes the bridge operate more like a traditional Ethernet switch and helps resolve Spanning Tree compatibility issues that can occur when VLAN interfaces are bridged. Configuring Bridge VLAN Filtering is highly recommended to comply with STP (IEEE 802.1D) and RSTP (IEEE 802.1W) standards, and it is mandatory to enable MSTP (IEEE 802.1s) support in RouterOS.

The primary VLAN setting is `vlan-filtering`, which globally controls VLAN awareness and VLAN tag processing for the bridge. When `vlan-filtering` is set to `no`, the bridge ignores VLAN tags, operates in shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) mode, and cannot modify VLAN tags of packets. Enabling `vlan-filtering` activates all bridge VLAN-related functionality and switches to independent-VLAN-learning (IVL) mode. In addition to joining ports for Layer 2 forwarding, the bridge itself functions as an interface and therefore has a Port VLAN ID (pvid).

:::warning
Currently, MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch and RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190, MT7621, MT7531, and EN7523 switch chips (since RouterOS v7) can use bridge VLAN filtering and hardware offloading simultaneously. Other devices cannot utilize the benefits of a built-in switch chip when bridge VLAN filtering is enabled. These devices should be configured according to the method described in the Basic VLAN switching guide. Using an improper configuration method can cause throughput issues in your network.
:::

### Bridge VLAN Table

The Bridge VLAN table defines per-VLAN port membership and specifies the VLAN tag action for egress traffic. Ports configured as `tagged` transmit frames with their corresponding VLAN ID, while ports configured as `untagged` remove the VLAN tag before transmitting frames. Bridge ports with `frame-types` set to `admit-all` or `admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged` are automatically added as untagged ports for their configured PVID.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/vlan`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **bridge** (*name*; Default: **none**) | The bridge interface to which this VLAN entry applies. |
| **disabled** (*yes* | *no*; Default: **no**) | Enables or disables the VLAN entry. |
| **tagged** (*interface*; Default: **none**) | Interfaces or [interface list](https://manual.mikrotik.com/cli-reference/interface/list) that transmit frames with a VLAN tag. This setting accepts comma-separated values, for example `tagged=ether1,ether2`. |
| **untagged** (*interface*; Default: **none**) | Interfaces or [interface list](https://manual.mikrotik.com/cli-reference/interface/list) that transmit frames without a VLAN tag. This setting accepts comma-separated values, for example `untagged=ether3,ether4`. |
| **vlan-ids** (*integer 1..4094*; Default: **1**) | The VLAN ID or list of VLAN IDs for this port configuration. This setting accepts VLAN ID ranges as well as comma-separated values, for example `vlan-ids=100-115,120,122,128-130`. |

:::danger
The `vlan-ids` parameter can specify a set or range of VLANs, but this should only be used for tagged ports configurations. When multiple VLANs are specified for access ports configurations, tagged packets may be sent as untagged packets through the wrong access port, regardless of the PVID value.
:::

:::warning
Ensure all required interfaces are added to the bridge VLAN table when using bridge VLAN filtering.

For routing functions to work properly on the same device through ports using bridge VLAN filtering, you must allow access to the bridge interface (this includes the switch-cpu port when hardware-offloaded VLAN filtering is used). This can be done manually by adding the bridge interface itself to the VLAN table as a tagged port. Since RouterOS v7.16, this is done automatically when adding a VLAN interface to a bridge with VLAN filtering enabled (a dynamic entry with the comment "added by vlan on bridge" appears under the `/interface/bridge/vlan` menu). Additional examples can be found in the inter-VLAN routing and management access sections.

Since RouterOS 7.20, a dynamic tagged entry named "added by switch-cpu" is added when the same VLAN ID spans multiple switch chips or is used on both hardware and software ports.
:::

:::danger
When allowing access to the CPU, you are permitting access from a specific port to the router/switch itself. This is not always desirable. Ensure you implement proper firewall filter rules to secure your device when CPU access is allowed from a specific VLAN ID and port. Use firewall filter rules to allow access only to required services.
:::

:::warning
Improperly configured bridge VLAN filtering can cause security issues. Ensure you fully understand how the [Bridge VLAN table](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/bridge-vlan-table.md) operates before deploying your device in a production environment.
:::

### Bridge Port Settings

Each bridge port has multiple VLAN-related settings that control untagged VLAN membership, VLAN tagging and untagging behavior, and packet filtering based on VLAN tag presence.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **frame-types** (*admit-all* | *admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged* | *admit-only-vlan-tagged*; Default: **admit-all**) | Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **ingress-filtering** (*yes* | *no*; Default: **yes**) | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge VLAN table. Should be used with `frame-types` to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7. |
| **pvid** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **1**) | Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |
| **tag-stacking** (*yes* | *no*; Default: **no**) | Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on the ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN tag regardless of whether a VLAN tag already exists; packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the `pvid` value and will use EtherType that is specified in `ether-type`. This property only has an effect when `vlan-filtering` is set to `yes`. |

### Bridge host table

The Bridge host table displays MAC addresses that have been learned on a bridge interface. When vlan-filtering is enabled, the table also shows the VLAN ID associated with each learned MAC address, enabling independent VLAN learning (IVL) mode.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/host/print where !local 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - external 
 #       MAC-ADDRESS        VID ON-INTERFACE       BRIDGE
0   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:AA  300 ether3             bridge1
1   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:AB  400 ether4             bridge1
```

### VLAN Example: Trunk and Access Ports

This section demonstrates how to configure a basic VLAN setup with one trunk port and multiple access ports. The trunk port (ether2) carries tagged VLAN traffic between switches or to a router, while access ports (ether6, ether7, ether8) connect to end devices and use untagged VLAN traffic.

![access_ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-03.webp)

#### Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface

Create a bridge interface with `vlan-filtering` disabled. This is important because enabling VLAN filtering immediately restricts traffic, which could lock you out of the device before the configuration is complete. For detailed information on managing access to the device during VLAN configuration, refer to the [Management access configuration](#management-access-configuration) section.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```

#### Step 2: Add Bridge Ports and Configure PVID

Add the physical interfaces to the bridge and configure the Port VLAN ID (pvid) for access ports. The pvid determines which VLAN untagged traffic is assigned to when entering the bridge. The `frame-types` setting controls what kind of traffic each port accepts: tagged only, untagged only, or both.

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```

#### Step 3: Create Bridge VLAN Table Entries

Create the bridge VLAN table entries. The trunk port (ether2) must be configured as a tagged member, meaning it will send and receive frames with VLAN tags. Access ports are automatically added as untagged members based on their pvid setting, so you only need to specify the tagged port in each VLAN entry.

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=400
```

#### Step 4: Enable VLAN Filtering

Once all VLAN settings are configured, enable VLAN filtering on the bridge to activate the VLAN functionality.

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```

#### Step 5: (Optional) Reject Untagged Traffic

As an optional security measure, you can set the bridge to reject untagged traffic by changing the frame-type. This prevents the default VLAN 1 (pvid=1) from being used and ensures only properly tagged traffic is accepted.

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```

### VLAN Example - Trunk and Hybrid Ports

![hybrid_ports](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-04.webp)

Create a bridge with disabled `vlan-filtering` to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured. If you need management access to the bridge, see the [Management access configuration](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#management-access-configuration) section.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```

Add bridge ports and specify `pvid` on hybrid VLAN ports to assign untagged traffic to the intended VLAN.  Use the `frame-types` setting to accept only tagged packets on ether2.

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400
```

Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example, egress VLAN tagging is done on ether6, ether7, ether8 ports too, making them into hybrid ports. Bridge ports with `frame-types` set to `admit-all` will be automatically added as untagged ports for the `pvid` VLAN.

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan 
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether7,ether8 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether8 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether7 vlan-ids=400
```

In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering.

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes 
```

An Optional step is to set `frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged` on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (`pvid=1`).

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```

:::danger
You don't have to add access ports as untagged ports, because they will be added dynamically as untagged ports with the VLAN ID that is specified in `pvid`, you can specify just the trunk port as a tagged port. All ports that have the same `pvid` set will be added as untagged ports in a single entry. You must take into account that the bridge itself is a port and it also has a `pvid` value, this means that the bridge port also will be added as an untagged port for the ports that have the same `pvid`. You can circumvent this behavior by either setting different `pvid` on all ports (even the trunk port and bridge itself), or using `frame-type` set to `accept-only-vlan-tagged`.

### VLAN Example - InterVLAN Routing by Bridge

![vlan_routing](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-05.webp)

Create a bridge with disabled `vlan-filtering` to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured.  If you need management access to the bridge, see the [Management access configuration](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/index.md#management-access-configuration) section.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```

Add bridge ports and specify `pvid` for VLAN access ports to assign their untagged traffic to the intended VLAN. Use the `frame-types` setting to accept only untagged packets.

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```

Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example **bridge1** interface is the VLAN trunk that will send traffic further to do InterVLAN routing. Bridge ports with `frame-types` set to `admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged` will be automatically added as untagged ports for the `pvid` VLAN.

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=400
```

Configure VLAN interfaces on the **bridge1** to allow handling of tagged VLAN traffic at the routing level and set IP addresses to ensure routing between VLANs as planned.

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN200 vlan-id=200
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN300 vlan-id=300
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN400 vlan-id=400

/ip/address
add address=20.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN200
add address=30.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN300
add address=40.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN400
```

In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes 
```

An optional step is to set `frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged` on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (`pvid=1`).

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```

Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details on [L3 Hardware Offloading](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/l3-hardware-offloading.md).

### Management access configuration

There are multiple ways to set up management access on a device that uses bridge VLAN filtering. Below are some of the most popular approaches to properly enable access to a router/switch. Start by creating a bridge without VLAN filtering enabled:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```

#### Untagged Access Without VLAN Filtering

In cases where VLAN filtering is not enabled on the bridge and management access via untagged traffic is required, the configuration is straightforward. The only necessary step is to assign an IP address directly to the bridge interface itself. Since the bridge operates at Layer 2 without VLAN tagging, any untagged traffic entering the bridge ports will be able to communicate with the IP address assigned to the bridge interface without additional configuration.

```ros
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```

This approach provides the simplest method for accessing the router or switch for management purposes when VLAN filtering is not part of the network design.

#### Tagged Access Without VLAN Filtering

This method is used when you want to manage the router/switch using tagged VLAN traffic, but without enabling bridge VLAN filtering. In this scenario, a separate VLAN interface is created on top of the bridge to handle the tagged management traffic. This approach is useful when you need to access the device through a specific VLAN ID while keeping the bridge configuration simple and straightforward.

To configure tagged management access, first create a VLAN interface on the bridge with the desired VLAN ID, then assign an IP address to that VLAN interface. This allows the router to be reachable through the tagged VLAN while maintaining the bridge in its default state (without VLAN filtering enabled). The VLAN interface acts as a logical sub-interface that inherits the MAC address from the parent bridge interface.

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```

This configuration creates a management VLAN (VLAN 99) on the bridge, making the device accessible at IP address 192.168.99.1 through any port that carries VLAN 99 tagged traffic.

#### Tagged Access with VLAN Filtering

In scenarios where VLAN filtering is enabled on the bridge and management access through tagged traffic is required, additional configuration steps are necessary. This method allows you to reach the router/switch management interface using a specific VLAN ID (VLAN 99 in this example) through tagged traffic on designated ports.

First, create a VLAN interface on top of the bridge and assign an IP address to it. This VLAN interface will handle the tagged management traffic:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```

Next, you must add the appropriate entries to the bridge VLAN table to permit tagged traffic on the ports where management access will be initiated. For instance, if you need to access the device from ports **ether3**, **ether4**, and **sfp-sfpplus1** using VLAN 99 tagged traffic, include the **bridge1** interface itself in the tagged port list (the bridge interface must be tagged to allow the VLAN interface to communicate with the switch CPU):

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```

Once the VLAN table is properly configured, you can enable VLAN filtering on the bridge:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```

This configuration enables management access through tagged VLAN 99 traffic while maintaining the security benefits of VLAN filtering. The bridge interface itself is included as a tagged member to ensure proper communication between the VLAN interface and the switch CPU for routing and management purposes.

### Untagged Access with VLAN Filtering

When bridge VLAN filtering is enabled and you need to access the device using untagged traffic, you must ensure that the management VLAN interface uses the same VLAN ID as the untagged port VLAN ID (configured via the `pvid` parameter). This ensures that untagged traffic from access ports can properly communicate with the router's management interface.

First, create a VLAN interface on the bridge and assign an IP address to it, just as you would in the previous example. This VLAN interface will handle the management traffic:

```ros
/interface/vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```

For example, if you want untagged ports **ether2** and **ether3** to be able to communicate with the VLAN 99 management interface, these ports must be configured with a `pvid` value that matches the management VLAN ID. Additionally, you need to add the bridge interface itself as a tagged port member in the VLAN table, which allows the router to process the tagged management traffic. You can also add additional tagged ports if needed for your specific network topology (see the previous examples for more details on tagged port configuration):

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface/bridge/vlan 
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```

Once you have completed the VLAN table configuration, you can enable VLAN filtering on the bridge. This will activate all VLAN-related functionality and begin filtering traffic based on your VLAN settings:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes 
```

#### Changing untagged VLAN for the bridge interface

In case VLAN filtering is used, it is possible to change the untagged VLAN ID for the bridge interface using the `pvid` setting. Note that creating routable VLAN interfaces and allowing tagged traffic on the bridge is a more flexible and generally recommended option.

First, create an IP address on the bridge interface.

```ros
/ip/address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```

For example, untagged **bridge1** traffic should be able to communicate with untagged **ether2** and **ether3** ports and tagged **sfp-sfpplus1** port in VLAN 99. In order to achieve this, **bridge1**, **ether2**, **ether3** should be configured with the same `pvid` and sfp-sfpplus1 should be added as a tagged member.

```ros
/interface/bridge
set [find name=bridge1] pvid=99
/interface/bridge/port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=bridge1,ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```

After that you can enable VLAN filtering:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes 
```

:::warning
If the connection to the router/switch through an IP address is not required, then steps for adding an IP address can be skipped since a connection to the router/switch through Layer2 protocols (e.g. MAC-telnet) will be working either way.
:::

### VLAN Tunneling (QinQ)

Since RouterOS v6.43 the RouterOS bridge is IEEE 802.1ad compliant and it is possible to filter VLAN IDs based on Service VLAN ID (0x88a8) rather than Customer VLAN ID (0x8100). The same principles can be applied as with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN filtering (the same setup examples can be used). Below is a topology for a common **Provider bridge**:

![Provider_bridge](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-06.webp)

In this example, **R1**, **R2**, **R3,** and **R4** might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic by 802.1Q (CVID), but **SW1** and **SW2** need to isolate traffic between routers in a way that **R1** is able to communicate only with **R3**, and **R2** is only able to communicate with **R4**. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with an SVID and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by enabling the service tag 0x88a8, introduced by `802.1ad`, on the bridge. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x88a8
```

In this setup, **ether1** and **ether2** are going to be access ports (untagged), use the `pvid` parameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port, use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```

Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```

When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2:**

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes 
```

:::danger
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU. Before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.

Note that if you are using the new EtherType/TPID 0x88a8 (service tag) and you also need a VLAN interface for your Service VLAN, you will also have to apply the `use-service-tag` parameter on the VLAN interface.
:::

:::danger
When `ether-type=0x8100` is configured, the bridge checks the outer VLAN tag to see if it is using EtherType `0x8100`. If the bridge receives a packet with an outer tag that has a different EtherType, it will mark the packet as `untagged`. Since RouterOS only checks the outer tag of a packet, it is not possible to filter 802.1Q packets when the 802.1ad protocol is used.
:::

:::warning
Currently, only MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch are capable of hardware offloaded VLAN filtering using the Service tag, EtherType/TPID `0x88a8`.
:::

:::danger
Devices with switch chip Marvell-98DX3257 (e.g. CRS354 series) do not support VLAN filtering on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for other VLAN types (`0x88a8` and `0x9100`).
:::

### Tag stacking

Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to forcefully add a new VLAN tag over any existing VLAN tags. This feature can be used to achieve a CVID stacking setup, where a CVID (0x8100) tag is added before an existing CVID tag. This type of setup is very similar to the Provider bridge setup. To achieve the same setup but with multiple CVID tags (CVID stacking) we can use the same topology:

![Tag_stacking](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-07.webp)

In this example **R1**, **R2**, **R3,** and **R4** might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic, it can be 802.1ad, 802.1Q or any other type of traffic, but **SW1** and **SW2** need to isolate traffic between routers in a way that **R1** is able to communicate only with **R3**, and **R2** is only able to communicate with **R4**. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with a new CVID tag and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by selecting the proper EtherType, use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x8100
```

In this setup, **ether1** and **ether2** will ignore any VLAN tags that are present and add a new VLAN tag. Use the `pvid` parameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port and allow `tag-stacking` on these ports. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge/port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```

Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table. You only need to specify the VLAN ID of the outer tag. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```

When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, which is required in order for the pvid parameter to have any effect. Use these commands on **SW1** and **SW2:**

```ros
/interface/bridge/set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```

:::danger
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU; before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.
:::

### MVRP

Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) is a protocol based on Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) which allows registering attributes (VLAN IDs in the case of MVRP) with other members of a Bridged LAN.

An MRP application can make or withdraw declarations of attributes which result in registration or leaving of those attributes with other MRP participants.

Here's how it works.

MRP consists of two parts:

- **Applicant** - responsible for sending declarations (or leaves). Its behavior can be configured on a per-port basis using the setting called `mvrp-applicant-state`, and per-VLAN using the `mvrp-forbidden` setting.
- **Registrar** - responsible for registering incoming declarations. Its configuration can be set per-port using the `mvrp-registrar-state` setting, and per-VLAN using the `mvrp-forbidden` setting.

**Registration Propagation:** Incoming registration on a bridge port dynamically makes that specific port a tagged VLAN member. Additionally, the attributes associated with this registration are spread to all active (forwarding) bridge ports as a declaration.

**Declaration Operation:** In case of MVRP, the configured VLANs get declared on each port, but they will only get configured as members of those VLANs when a declaration is received from the LAN (Registrar will register the VLAN). From the perspective of an end-station, a single declaration will be registered on each upstream port across the entire LAN. When another end-station declares the same attribute, a path of registrations will be made between the two (or more) end stations, see the picture below.

MVRP helps to dynamically propagate VLAN information throughout the bridged network and configure VLANs only on the needed ports. This makes the network efficient by avoiding unnecessary traffic flooding.

As noted before, MVRP is only active on ports that are forwarding. In the case of MSTP, declarations and registrations are made only if the port is forwarding in the MSTI in which the VLAN is mapped.

The point-to-point ports speed up the process of registration (or leaving). Manually configuring `point-to-point=yes` can be advantageous for non-Ethernet interfaces.

![MVRP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-08.webp)

#### Property Reference

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mvrp** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: **no**) | Enables MVRP for bridge. It ensures that the MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:21 is trapped and not forwarded. The `vlan-filtering` must be enabled. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/port`

The port menu enables control over the applicant and registrar settings on a per-port basis.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mvrp-applicant-state** (*non-participant \| normal-participant;* Default: **normal-participant**) | MVRP applicant options: non-participant - port does not send any MRP messages;normal-participant - port participates normally in MRP exchanges. |
| **mvrp-registrar-state** (*fixed \| normal*; Default: **normal**) | MVRP registrar options: fixed - port ignores all MRP messages, and remains Registered (IN) in all configured vlans.normal - port receives MRP messages and handles them according to the standard. |

To monitor the currently declared and registered VLAN IDs, use the `monitor` command.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/bridge/port/monitor [find interface=sfp-sfpplus1]
            interface: sfp-sfpplus1

```

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/vlan`

All ports that are members of static VLANs or dynamic untagged VLANs created by the port `pvid` setting are treated as "fixed." This means the registrar disregards all MRP messages and remains registered (IN) for those VLANs.

When a VLAN is neither manually configured nor created by the port `pvid` setting, incoming registrations on a bridge port can dynamically designate that specific port as a tagged VLAN member. The `mvrp-forbidden` feature allows creating a list of ports that are restricted from registering for a specific VLAN ID.

VLANs that are static or dynamic will be declared by the applicants unless this functionality is disabled by the port's `mvrp-applicant-state`, or by the VLAN's `mvrp-forbidden` setting.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **mvrp-forbidden** (*interfaces*; Default: ) | Ports that ignore all MRP messages and remain Not Registered (MT), as well as disable applicant from declaring specific VLAN ID. |

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/vlan/mvrp`

The MVRP attributes menu can be used to see internal MVRP attribute states, as specified in the IEEE 802.1Q-2011.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **applicant-state** | The Applicant state machine that declares attributes. Its state can be VO, VP, VN, AN, AA, QA, LA, AO, QO, AP, QP, or LO. Each state consists of two letters.  The first letter indicates the state: V—Very anxious;A—Anxious;Q—Quiet;L—Leaving. The second letter indicates the membership state: A - Active member;P - Passive member;O - Observer;N - New. For example, VP indicates "Very anxious, Passive member." |
| **registrar-state** | The Registrar state machine that records the registration state of attributes declared by other participants. Its state can be IN, LV, or MT: IN—Registered;LV—Previously registered, but now being timed out;MT—Not registered. |

## Fast Forward

---

Fast Forward allows forwarding packets faster under special conditions. When Fast Forward is enabled, then the bridge can process packets even faster since it can skip multiple bridge-related checks, including MAC learning. Below you can find a list of conditions that **MUST** be met in order for Fast Forward to be active:

- Bridge has `fast-forward` set to `yes`.
- Bridge has only 2 running ports.
- Both bridge ports support [Fast Path](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md#fast-path), Fast Path is active on ports and globally on the bridge.
- Bridge Hardware Offloading is disabled.
- Bridge VLAN Filtering is disabled.
- Bridge DHCP snooping is disabled.
- `unknown-multicast-flood` is set to `yes`.
- `unknown-unicast-flood` is set to `yes`.
- `broadcast-flood` is set to `yes`.
- MAC address for the bridge matches a MAC address from one of the bridge slave ports.
- `horizon` for both ports is set to `none`.

:::warning
Fast Forward disables MAC learning; this is by design to achieve faster packet forwarding. MAC learning prevents traffic from flooding multiple interfaces, but MAC learning is not needed when a packet can only be sent out through just one interface.
:::

:::danger
Fast Forward is disabled when hardware offloading is enabled. Hardware offloading can achieve full wire-speed performance when it is active since it will use the built-in switch chip (if such exists on your device). Fast forward uses the CPU to forward packets. When comparing throughput results, you would get such results: Hardware offloading > Fast Forward > Fast Path > Slow Path.
:::

It is possible to check how many packets were processed by Fast Forward:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/settings> pr
              use-ip-firewall: no
     use-ip-firewall-for-vlan: no
    use-ip-firewall-for-pppoe: no
              allow-fast-path: yes
      bridge-fast-path-active: yes
     bridge-fast-path-packets: 0
       bridge-fast-path-bytes: 0
  bridge-fast-forward-packets: 16423
    bridge-fast-forward-bytes: 24864422
```

:::warning
If packets are processed by Fast Path, then Fast Forward is not active. Packet count can be used as an indicator of whether Fast Forward is active or not.

Since RouterOS 6.44 it is possible to monitor Fast Forward status, for example:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/bridge/monitor bridge1 
                  state: enabled
    current-mac-address: B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7
            root-bridge: yes
         root-bridge-id: 0x8000.B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7
         root-path-cost: 0
              root-port: none
             port-count: 2
  designated-port-count: 2
           fast-forward: yes
```

:::danger
Disabling or enabling fast-forward will temporarily disable all bridge ports for settings to take effect. This must be taken into account whenever changing this property in production environments since it can cause all packets to be temporarily dropped.

## IGMP/MLD Snooping

---

The bridge supports IGMP/MLD snooping. It controls multicast streams and prevents multicast flooding on unnecessary ports. Its settings are placed in the bridge menu and it works independently on every bridge interface. Software-driven implementation works on all devices with RouterOS, but MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch, and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips also support IGMP/MLD snooping with hardware offloading. See more details on [IGMP/MLD snooping manual](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/user-guides/bridge-igmp-mld-snooping.md).

## DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82

---

DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82 are supported by bridge. The DHCP Snooping is a Layer2 security feature that prevents unauthorized DHCP servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where a known DHCP server resides and DHCP messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCP server messages will be dropped). The DHCP Option 82 is additional information (Agent Circuit ID and Agent Remote ID) provided by DHCP Snooping enabled devices that allows identifying the device itself and DHCP clients.

![Dhcp_snooping](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-09.webp)

In this example, SW1 and SW2 are DHCP Snooping and Option 82-enabled devices. First, we need to create a bridge, assign interfaces and mark trusted ports. Use these commands on **SW1**:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
```

For SW2, the configuration will be similar, but we also need to mark ether1 as trusted, because this interface is going to receive DHCP messages with Option 82 already added. You need to mark all ports as trusted if they are going to receive DHCP messages with added Option 82, otherwise these messages will be dropped. Also, we add ether3 to the same bridge and leave this port untrusted, imagining there is an unauthorized (rogue) DHCP server. Use these commands on **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```

Then we need to enable DHCP Snooping and configure Option 82. Starting from RouterOS version 7.23, it is possible to configure custom Remote ID and Circuit ID values using predefined variables (such as BRIDGEMAC, HOSTNAME, INTERFACE, VID). See the `dhcp-agent-circuit-id`, `dhcp-agent-remote-id` properties for more details. In case your DHCP server does not support DHCP Option 82 or you do not implement any Option 82-related policies, this step is not mandatory. In this configuration example, we are using these commands on **SW1** and **SW2**:

```ros
/interface/bridge
set [find where name="bridge"] dhcp-snooping=yes dhcp-agent-circuit-id="interface: \$(INTERFACE), vlan: \$(VID)" dhcp-agent-remote-id="ip: 192.168.88.1, identity: \$(HOSTNAME), mac: \$(BRIDGEMAC)"
```

Now both devices will analyze what DHCP messages are received on bridge ports. The **SW1** is responsible for adding and removing the DHCP Option 82. The **SW2** will limit rogue DHCP servers from receiving any discovery messages and drop malicious DHCP server messages from ether3.

:::warning
Currently, MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips fully support hardware offloaded DHCP Snooping and Option 82. For CRS1xx and CRS2xx series switches, it is possible to use DHCP Snooping along with VLAN switching, but then you need to make sure that DHCP packets are sent out with the correct VLAN tag using egress ACL rules. Other devices are capable of using DHCP Snooping and Option 82 features along with hardware offloading, but you must make sure that there is no VLAN-related configuration applied to the device, otherwise, DHCP Snooping and Option 82 might not work properly. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
:::

:::info
Starting from RouterOS v7.17, DHCP snooping is supported with hardware offloading on bonding interfaces.

### DHCP Snooping Binding Table

The DHCP snooping binding database is a runtime table generated by a bridge and intended to store DHCP leases provided by DHCP servers connected to trusted ports. Each entry records the client’s MAC address, assigned IP address, lease expiration time, VLAN ID, and the physical interface on which the client was seen. The bridge can utilize this database to enhance security. Namely, when a frame arrives on an untrusted port, the switch verifies that the source MAC/IP pair matches a stored binding before forwarding the packet, thereby blocking traffic from rogue DHCP servers or spoofed hosts, preventing address‑theft attacks, and enabling features such as IP‑Source‑Guard, ARP‑Inspection.

The present implementation of the DHCPv4 snooping binding table has been built on top of the existing `/interface/bridge/host` table. The relevant DHCP information is retrieved from DHCP messages traversing the bridge.

:::danger
The DHCP snooping binding table is cleared whenever the bridge interface configuration is changed, including enabling the `arp-inspection` or `ip-source-guard` features. As a result, IPv4 and ARP traffic on untrusted ports is interrupted until clients obtain or renew their DHCP leases. To repopulate the binding table more quickly, disable and re-enable the untrusted Ethernet interfaces or reboot the switch.
:::

The current status of the DHCP client is indicated by the `dhcpv4-status`. The possible status values are as follows: `searching`, `requesting`, `bound`, `renewing`, `rebinding`, `expired`, and `relay-agent`. The last one can appear only when a DHCP request message is received from a DHCP client hiding behind a relay agent.

The `dhcpv4-ip` shows the IP addresses granted by DHCP servers, while the `dhcpv4-server-id` column indicates the server ID. The `dhcpv4-expires-after` column shows the time left till the end of the current lease period provided by the DHCP server to a client.

When VLAN filtering is enabled on the bridge each host is identified not only by its MAC address, but by a pair MAC - VLAN ID.

### ARP Inspection and IP Source Guard

ARP Inspection and IP Source Guard are Layer 2 security features that use the DHCP snooping binding table to prevent address spoofing attacks. ARP Inspection validates ARP packets against the binding database, dropping any that do not match. IP Source Guard validates the source IP address of IPv4 packets, dropping those not found in a binding entry for the ingress port. On trusted ports, all ARP packets and IP traffic are forwarded without verification.

First, enable DHCP snooping on the bridge and mark the ports connected to your DHCP server as trusted:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set [find name="bridge1"] dhcp-snooping=yes
/interface/bridge/port/set [find interface=ether1] trusted=yes
```

Enable ARP inspection and designate trusted ARP ports:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set [find name="bridge1"] arp-inspection=yes
/interface/bridge/port/set [find interface=ether1] trusted-arp=yes
```

Enable IP Source Guard:

```ros
/interface/bridge/set [find name="bridge1"] ip-source-guard=yes
```

:::danger
The DHCP snooping binding table is cleared whenever the bridge interface configuration is changed, including enabling the `arp-inspection` or `ip-source-guard` features. As a result, IPv4 and ARP traffic on untrusted ports is interrupted until clients obtain or renew their DHCP leases. To repopulate the binding table more quickly, disable and re-enable the untrusted Ethernet interfaces or reboot the switch.
:::

Print the bridge host table to verify that DHCP bindings are being learned:

```ros
/interface/bridge/host/print where dhcpv4-status
```

Check the `/interface/ethernet/switch/rule` to verify switch ACL rules are applied (supported only on Marvell Prestera switch chips):

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print 
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
0 D switch=switch1 mac-protocol=ip protocol=udp src-port=67-68 dst-port=67-68 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=yes mirror=no

4 D ;;; IPSG (Drop Untrusted)
    switch=switch1 ports=ether2,ether3,ether4 mac-protocol=ip copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports=""
```

Look for `bridge,warning` log entries to detect blocked packets:

```ros
/log/print where topics~"bridge" and topics~"warning"

2026-07-26 12:08:29 bridge,warning ether2: dropped IP packet on untrusted port - MAC/IP does not match binding table entry (IP=192.168.88.55, MAC=6c:3b:6b:eb:76:aa)

2026-07-26 13:55:02 bridge,warning ether2: dropped ARP packet on untrusted port - unknown MAC/IP combination (src IP=192.168.88.55, MAC=6c:3b:6b:eb:76:aa)
```

## DHCPv6 Snooping / DHCPv6 Shield

DHCPv6 Snooping is a Layer2 security feature that prevents unauthorized DHCPv6 servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where the known DHCPv6 server resides and DHCPv6 messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCPv6 server messages will be dropped, effectively implementing DHCPv6-Shield).

The DHCPv6 Option 18 (Interface-Id) and Option 37 (Remote-Id) are additional information provided by DHCPv6 Snooping enabled devices that allow identifying the device itself and DHCPv6 clients.

IPv6 allows a more granular approach as well as flexibility with the DHCPv6 Relay agent process. Functionally, these serve the exact same purpose as IPv4's Option 82: Option 18 acts as the Circuit ID (identifying the specific port/VLAN the client is attached to), and Option 37 acts as the Remote ID (identifying the relay agent or switch hardware itself).

- Option 18 - identifies the specific interface (port) on which the client's message was received. It ensures the server knows exactly where the request came through so it can apply the correct policy.
- Option 37 - identifies the relay agent (the switch or router) itself. It contains a unique caller ID (like the DUID—DHCP Unique Identifier). It tells the server which specific device in the network is talking to it.

## RA Guard

---

The RA guard feature is intended for discarding IPv6 packets containing router advertisement (RA) messages arriving on bridge ports specified by the user as untrusted ones, thereby allowing one to prevent potential rogue RA message-based attacks or accidental network misconfiguration. When enabled, it is possible to set each bridge port either as trusted or untrusted (by default all the bridge ports are set as RA untrusted).

Here are the network scheme and core principle behind IPv6 RA Guard (Router Advertisement Guard).

![RAguard](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/img/index-10.webp)

|  |
| :-- |
| `#Layer 2 Access Switch - enabling RA guard on the main bridge``/interface/bridge``add name=bridge``/interface/bridge``set [find where name="bridge"] ra-guard=yes``/interface/bridge/port``add bridge=bridge interface=etherUplink Trusted RA=yes``add bridge=bridge interface=etherX``add bridge=bridge interface=etherY``add bridge=bridge interface=etherZ` |

### The Problem: Why is this needed?

In IPv6, devices use ICMPv6 to auto-configure themselves.

Router Advertisements (Type 134): Routers broadcast these messages to tell hosts: "I am the gateway, and here is your network prefix."

The Threat: If a user accidentally connects a consumer router (like a home Wi-Fi router) or a malicious actor launches a tool (like `Rogue RA`) on an access port, that device will start broadcasting RAs.

The Result: Other hosts on the network will auto-configure their IPv6 addresses based on the rogue device and set the rogue device as their default gateway. This causes a Man-in-the-Middle attack or a complete denial of service.

Here is the network scheme and the core principle behind IPv6 RA Guard (Router Advertisement Guard).

### The Core Principle: "Trust vs. Untrust"

The fundamental principle of IPv6 RA Guard is logically identical to DHCP Snooping in IPv4. It creates a security boundary within the Layer 2 switch infrastructure by categorizing switch ports into two roles:

- Trusted Ports: Ports connected to legitimate, authorized IPv6 routers. These ports are allowed to send Router Advertisement (RA) packets.
- Untrusted Ports: Ports connected to end-user hosts. These ports are blocked from sending RA packets.

### Packet parsing process

For ports not configured as RA Trusted, the RA Guard parser traverses the extension header chain until it encounters a non-extension header. The parsing process and subsequent actions are governed by the following rules:

**Transport Layer Termination**: If the parser encounters a valid transport layer header—such as TCP, UDP, ESP, RSVP, or an encapsulated IPv4/IPv6 header—parsing terminates and the packet is forwarded (subject to standard bridge checks).

- Drop Conditions - The packet is discarded if:

1. It fails to contain a transport layer header.
2. The final extension header in the chain does not specify NO\_NEXT\_HEADER (59) in its "Next Header" field.
3. If the ICMP message type is found to be 134, the packet is dropped.

- Fragmentation Handling: These parsing rules apply exclusively to the first fragment of fragmented IPv6 packets. Subsequent fragments are forwarded regardless of their content, as they do not contain the protocol headers necessary for RA identification.

## Bridge Firewall

---

The bridge firewall implements packet filtering and thereby provides security functions that are used to manage data flow to, from, and through the bridge.

[Packet flow diagram](https://manual.mikrotik.com/firewall-and-quality-of-service/packet-flow-in-routeros.md) shows how packets are processed through the router. It is possible to force bridge traffic to go through `/ip/firewall/filter` rules (see the bridge settings).

There are two bridge firewall tables:

- **filter** - bridge firewall with three predefined chains:
  - **input** - filters packets, where the destination is the bridge (including those packets that will be routed, as they are destined to the bridge MAC address anyway).
  - **output** - filters packets, which come from the bridge (including those packets that have been routed normally).
  - **forward** - filters packets, which are to be bridged (note: this chain is not applied to the packets that should be routed through the router, just to those that are traversing between the ports of the same bridge).
- **nat** - bridge network address translation provides ways for changing source/destination MAC addresses of the packets traversing a bridge. Has two built-in chains:
  - **srcnat** - used for "hiding" a host or a network behind a different MAC address. This chain is applied to the packets leaving the router through a bridged interface.
  - **dstnat** - used for redirecting some packets to other destinations.

You can put packet marks in the bridge firewall (filter and NAT), which are the same as the packet marks in the IP firewall configured by `'/ip/firewall/mangle'`. In this way, packet marks put by the bridge firewall can be used in the 'IP firewall', and vice versa.

General bridge firewall properties are described in this section. Some parameters that differ between nat and filter rules are described in further sections.

| **vlan-encap** (*802.2 \| arp \| ip \| ipv6 \| ipx \| length \| mpls-multicast \| mpls-unicast \| pppoe \| pppoe-discovery \| rarp \| vlan \| integer 0..65535 \| hex 0x0000-0xffff*; Default: ) | Matches the MAC protocol type encapsulated in the VLAN frame. |
| **vlan-id** (*integer 0..4095*; Default: ) | Matches the VLAN identifier field. |
| **vlan-priority** (*integer 0..7*; Default: ) | Matches the VLAN priority (priority code point) |

Footnotes:

- STP matchers are only valid if the destination MAC address is `01:80:C2:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (Bridge Group address), also STP should be enabled.

- ARP matchers are only valid if mac-protocol is `arp` or `rarp`.

- VLAN matchers are only valid for `0x8100` or `0x88a8` ethernet protocols.

- IP or IPv6 related matchers are only valid if mac-protocol is either set to `ip` or `ipv6`.

- 802.3 matchers are only consulted if the actual frame is compliant with IEEE 802.2 and IEEE 802.3 standards. These matchers are ignored for other packets.

### Bridge Packet Filter

This section describes specific bridge filter options.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/filter`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **action** (*accept \| drop \| jump \| log \| mark-packet \| passthrough \| return \| set-priority*; Default: **accept**) | Action to take if the packet is matched by the rule:accept - accept the packet. No action, i.e., the packet is passed through without undertaking any action, and no more rules are processed in the relevant list/chaindrop - silently drop the packet (without sending the ICMP reject message)jump - jump to the chain specified by the value of the jump-target argumentlog - add a message to the system log containing the following data: in-interface, out-interface, src-mac, dst-mac, eth-proto, protocol, src-ip:port-&gt;dst-ip:port and length of the packet. After the packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar to passthroughmark - mark the packet to use the mark laterpassthrough - ignore this rule and go on to the next one. Acts the same way as a disabled rule, except for the ability to count packetsreturn - return to the previous chain, from where the jump took placeset-priority - set priority specified by the new-priority parameter on the packets sent out through a link that is capable of transporting priority (VLAN or WMM-enabled wireless interface).

### Bridge NAT

This section describes specific bridge NAT options.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/bridge/nat`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **action** (*accept \| drop \| jump \| mark-packet \| redirect \| set-priority \| arp-reply \| dst-nat \| log \| passthrough \| return \| src-nat*; Default: **accept**) | Action to take if the packet is matched by the rule:accept - accept the packet. No action, i.e., the packet is passed through without undertaking any action, and no more rules are processed in the relevant list/chainarp-reply - send a reply to an ARP request (any other packets will be ignored by this rule) with the specified MAC address (only valid in dstnat chain)drop - silently drop the packet (without sending the ICMP reject message)dst-nat - change the destination MAC address of a packet (only valid in dstnat chain)jump - jump to the chain specified by the value of the jump-target argumentlog - log the packetmark - mark the packet to use the mark laterpassthrough - ignore this rule and go on to the next one. Acts the same way as a disabled rule, except for the ability to count packetsredirect - redirect the packet to the bridge itself (only valid in dstnat chain)return - return to the previous chain, from where the jump took placeset-priority - set the priority specified by the new-priority parameter on the packets sent out through a link that is capable of transporting priority (VLAN or WMM-enabled wireless interface). Read moresrc-nat - change the source MAC address of a packet (only valid in srcnat chain) |
| **to-arp-reply-mac-address** (*MAC address*; Default: ) | Source MAC address to put in the Ethernet frame and the ARP payload, when `action=arp-reply` is selected |
| **to-dst-mac-address** (*MAC address*; Default: ) | Destination MAC address to put in Ethernet frames, when `action=dst-nat` is selected |
| **to-src-mac-address** (*MAC address*; Default: ) | Source MAC address to put in Ethernet frames, when `action=src-nat` is selected |
