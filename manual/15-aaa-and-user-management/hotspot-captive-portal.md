# HotSpot - Captive portal

The MikroTik HotSpot Gateway provides authentication for clients before access to public networks.

:::warning
HotSpot (captive portal) - uses web-proxy and it is capable of using only the default routing table, at the moment, making the PCC(per connection-classifier) not a valid method, due to the multiple routing tables used.
:::

:::warning
HotSpot functionality could be blocked by the device-mode. Prior to configuring HotSpot, make sure that it is enabled in `/system/device-mode` ([more info](https://manual.mikrotik.com/system-information-and-utilities/device-mode.md).

### HotSpot Properties

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **name** | Descriptive name for the HotSpot server instance. |
| **interface** | The specific local interface (physical or virtual) where the HotSpot service will listen for client requests. |
| **address-pool** | The IP address pool from which HotSpot clients will receive their IP addresses via DHCP. |
| **profile** | Reference to the HotSpot Server Profile containing common settings like login methods and HTML directory. |
| **idle-timeout** | The period of inactivity after which a client is automatically logged out if no traffic is detected. |
| **keepalive-timeout** | The time interval used to check if the client is still reachable; if the client does not respond, the session is terminated. |
| **login-timeout** | The maximum duration allowed for a client to complete the authentication process after the login page is displayed. |
| **addresses-per-mac** | Limits the number of IP addresses that can be associated with a single MAC address. |
| **proxy-status** | Indicates the current operational state of the internal web-proxy used by the HotSpot system. |

### HotSpot Gateway features

- Different authentication methods of clients, using a local client database on the router, or a remote RADIUS server.
- User accounting in a local database on the router, or on a remote RADIUS server.
- A walled-garden system, access to some web pages without authorization.
- Login page modification, where you can put information about the company.
- Automatic and transparent change of any IP address of a client to a valid address.
- HotSpot can inform DHCP clients that they are behind a captive portal (RFC7710).

A HotSpot can work reliably only when IPv4 is used. HotSpot relies on Firewall NAT rules which currently are not supported for IPv6.

## HotSpot

**Sub-menu:** `/ip/hotspot`

The menu is designed to manage the HotSpot servers of the router. It is possible to run HotSpot on Ethernet, wireless, VLAN, and bridge interfaces. One HotSpot server is allowed per interface. When HotSpot is configured on the bridge interface, set the HotSpot interface as the bridge interface, not as a bridge port, do not add public interfaces to bridge ports. You can add HotSpot servers manually to the *`/ip/hotspot`* menu, but it is advised to run *`/ip/hotspot/setup`*, which adds all necessary settings.

| Parameters | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **name** (text) | HotSpot server's name or identifier |
| **address-pool** (name/none; default: *none*) | address space used to change any HotSpot client IP address to a valid address. Useful for providing public network access to mobile clients that are not willing to change their networking settings |
| **idle-timeout** (time/none; default: *5m*) | period of inactivity for unauthorized clients. When there is no traffic from this client (literally, the client computer should be switched off), once the timeout is reached, a user is dropped from the HotSpot host list, its used address becomes available |
| **keepalive-timeout** (time/none; default: *none*) | Value of how long the host can stay out of reach to be removed from the HotSpot |
| **login-timeout** (time/none; default: *none*) | Period of time after which if a host hasn't been authorized with the system the host entry gets deleted from the host table. Loop repeats until the host logs in to the system. Enable if there are situations where a host cannot log in after being too long in the host table unauthorized. |
| **interface** (name of an interface) | Interface to run HotSpot on |
| **addresses-per-mac** (integer**/**unlimited; default: 2) | Number of IP addresses allowed to be bound with the MAC address, when multiple HotSpot clients are connected with one MAC-address |
| **profile** (name; default: ***default*)** | HotSpot server default HotSpot profile, which is located in *`/ip/hotspot/profile`* |

## Read-only

| Parameters | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| keepalive-timeout (read-only; time) | The exact value of the keepalive-timeout that is applied to the user. The value shows how long the host can stay out of reach to be removed from the HotSpot |

## HotSpot Profile

This submenu contains a list of HotSpot server profiles. There may be various different HotSpot systems, defined as Server Profiles, on the same gateway machine. One or more interfaces can be grouped into one server profile. There are very few settings for the servers on particular interfaces - most of the configuration is set in the server profiles. For example, it is possible to make a completely different set of servlet pages for each server profile, and define different RADIUS servers for authentication.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **dns-name** (*string*; Default: **""**) | DNS name of the HotSpot server. This is the DNS name used as the name of the HotSpot server (i.e., it appears as the location of the login page). This name will automatically be added as a static DNS entry in the DNS cache. |

| **https-redirect** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Whether to redirect the unauthenticated user to the HotSpot login page, if the user is visiting an https:// url. Since the certificate domain name will mismatch, often this leads to errors, so you can set this parameter to "no" and all https requests will simply be rejected and user will have to visit an http page. |
| **login-by** (*cookie\|http-chap\|http-pap\|https\|mac\|trial\|mac-cookie*; Default: **http-chap, cookie**) | The HotSpot authentication method usedmac-cookie - enables login by mac cookie methodcookie - may only be used with another HTTP authentication method. HTTP cookie is generated, when the user authenticates in HotSpot for the first time. User is not asked for the login/password and is authenticated automatically, until cookie-lifetime is activehttp-chap - login/password is required for the user to authenticate in HotSpot. CHAP challenge-response method with MD5 hashing algorithm is used for protecting passwords.http-pap - login/password is required for user to authenticate in HotSpot. Username and password are sent over network in plain text.https - login/password is required for user to authenticate in HotSpot. Client login/password exchange between client and server is encrypted with SSL tunnel. mac - client is authenticated without asking for a login form. Client MAC-address is added to `/ip/hotspot/user` database, client is authenticated as soon as connected to the HotSpottrial - client is allowed to use the internet without HotSpot login for the specified amount of time |

All rates should be numbers with optional 'k' (1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If tx-rate is not specified, rx-rate is as tx-rate too. Same goes for tx-burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate are used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as the default. rx-rate-min and tx-rate min are the values of limit-at properties |

Regular expressions are also accepted here, but if the property should be treated as a regular expression, it should start with a colon (':'). To show that no symbols are allowed before the given pattern, we use the ^ symbol at the beginning of the pattern. To specify that no symbols are allowed after the given pattern, we use the $ symbol at the end of the pattern.

### Example

To only permit bypassed access in the walled garden to "[www.example.com/test](http://www.example.com/test)" but not to "[www.example.com/test/test.php](http://www.example.com/test/test.php)" :

```
/ip/hotspot/walled-garden
add dst-host=:^www.example.com path=":/test\$"
```

## HotSpot walled-garden ip

To bypass HotSpot authentication for other protocols and different src/dst addresses (or address-lists). Used for different services (Winbox, SSH, Telnet, SIP, etc.)

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **action** (*accept \|drop\|reject*; Default: **allow**) | Action to perform, when the packet matches the ruleallow - allow access to the opened service without authorizationdrop - the authorization is required to access the servicereject - the authorization is required to access the service, when the service is accessed, an ICMP reject message host-unreachable will be generated |
| **server** (*string*; Default: ) | Name of the HotSpot server, rule is applied to. |
| **src-address** (*IP*; Default: ) | Source address of the user, usually the IP address of the HotSpot client |
| **dst-address** (*IP*; Default: ) | Destination IP address, the IP address of the WEB-server. Ignored if **dst-host** is already specified. |
| **src-address-list** (*string*; Default: ) | Source address list name |
| **dst-address-list** (*string*; Default: ) | Destination address list. Ignored if **dst-host** is already specified. |
| **dst-host** (*string*; Default: ) | Domain name of the destination web-server. When this parameter is specified, a dynamic entry is added to Walled Garden |
| **dst-port** (*integer*; Default: ) | TCP port number, client sends request to |
| **protocol** (*integer \| string*; Default: ) | IP protocol |

## IP Binding

**Sub-menu:** `/ip/hotspot/ip-binding`

IP-Binding HotSpot menu allows the setup of static One-to-One NAT translations, allows bypassing specific HotSpot clients without any authentication, and also allows blocking specific hosts and subnets from the HotSpot network

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **address** (*IP Range*; Default: **""**) | The original IP address of the client |
| **mac-address** (*MAC*; Default: **""**) | MAC address of the client |
| **server** (*string \| all*; Default: **"all"**) | Name of the HotSpot server.all - will be applied to all HotSpot servers |
| **to-address** (*IP*; Default: **""**) | New IP address of the client, translation occurs on the router (client does not know anything about the translation) |
| **type** (*blocked \| bypassed \| regular*; Default: **""**) | Type of the IP-binding actionregular - performs One-to-One NAT according to the rule, translates the address to to-addressbypassed - performs the translation, but excludes the client from login to the HotSpotblocked - translation is not performed and packets from a host are dropped |

## Cookies

The menu contains all cookies sent to the HotSpot clients, which are authorized by the cookie method. All the entries are read-only.

**Sub-menu:** `/ip/hotspot/cookie`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **domain** (*string*) | The domain name (if split from the username) |
| **expires-in** (*time*) | How long the cookie is valid |
| **mac-address** (*MAC*) | Client's MAC-address |
| **user** (*string*) | HotSpot username |

## MAC Cookie

MAC cookie is a HotSpot feature, designed to improve accessibility for smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices.

When the MAC cookie feature is enabled (**login-by**=mac-cookie, **add-mac-cookie**=yes set in user profile), the following actions are taken:

- **First successful login**. Mac cookie keeps a record of username and password for the MAC address if there is only one host with such a MAC. Cookie timeout is set to a value equal to mac-cookie-timeout.
- **New host appears**. HotSpot checks if there is a mac cookie record for the MAC address and logs in the host using the recorded username and password. If there is more than one host with the same MAC address, the user will not be logged in and the MAC cookie record for this address will be deleted.

When **a user logs out** mac cookie is removed in the following cases:

- user-request - User clicked on the logout button.
- admin-reset - Disconnected from the radius server or the user is removed from the HotSpot active menu.
- nas-request - Traffic limit reached.
- session-timeout.

To debug problems with mac-cookies you will need to enable HotSpot debug logs and look for reasons why mac-cookie login didn't work for a certain host.

### Reasons when mac cookie is removed by server

- `/ip/hotspot/cookie/remove [number]`.
- Radius server sends Disconnect-Request.
- End-User has logged out himself via HotSpot status page.
- End user has reached his data cap ("traffic limit reached").
- Session-Timeout.
- If mac-cookie login fails.
- If the server detects that in the host table there is more than one entry with the same mac-address.

### Properties of the HotSpot API JSON (RFC 7710)

Based on the `api.json` template provided in the documentation, here are the descriptions for each property used to communicate captive portal status to client devices:

- **captive**: A boolean value (`true` or `false`) that informs the client device whether it is currently restricted by the captive portal. If the user is already authenticated, it returns `false`.
- **user-portal-url**: The specific URL where the user can access the login page or manage their current session. In MikroTik RouterOS, this is dynamically populated by the `$(link-login-only)` variable.
- **seconds-remaining**: (Optional) An integer representing the number of seconds left before the current session expires. This is only included if a session timeout is configured.
- **bytes-remaining**: (Optional) An integer representing the remaining data quota in bytes available to the user. This is only included if data limits are applied to the HotSpot user.
- **can-extend-session**: A boolean value indicating whether the user has the ability to extend their current session or purchase/request more time/data via the portal.

## Load balancing with mangle on HotSpot server

In a multi-uplink HotSpot setup (for example, [PCC](https://manual.mikrotik.com/high-availability-solutions/load-balancing/per-connection-classifier.md), default routing often might fail to work as expected because the router prioritises mangle rules over the local destination check.

To fix this, ensure traffic destined for the HotSpot server is routed via the **local** table before the **mangle** chain is evaluated. You can achieve this by:

1. Adjusting the "`/routing/settings"` ([Routing table lookup](https://manual.mikrotik.com/user-guides/routing-and-networking-protocols/routing-decision.md#routing-table-lookup).
2. Or, adding specific "`/routing/rule"` entries to force the HotSpot server's traffic to use the local table first (including HTTP 80 traffic which is used to detect the HotSpot server).
