# Dot1X

Dot1X is an implementation of the IEEE 802.1X standard in RouterOS. The main purpose is to provide port-based network access control using EAP over LAN also known as EAPOL. 802.1X consists of a supplicant (client), an authenticator (server) and an authentication server (RADIUS server). Both authenticator and supplicant sides are supported in RouterOS, as well as the authentication server when [User Manager](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/user-manager.md) package is installed. Supported EAP methods for the supplicant are EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2.

:::warning
The feature is not supported on SMIPS devices (hAP lite, hAP lite TC and hAP mini).

## Client

Supplicant configuration settings.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/dot1x/client`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **anon-identity** (*string*; Default: ) | Identity for outer layer EAP authentication. Used only with `eap-ttls` and `eap-peap` methods. If not set, value from `identity` parameter will be used for outer layer EAP authentication. |
| **client-certificate** (*string*; Default: ) | Name of a certificate listed in [System/Certificates](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates.md). Necessary when `eap-tls` method is used. |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Short description of the entry. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Whether client is enabled or not. |
| **eap-methods** (*eap-tls \| eap-ttls \| eap-peap \| eap-mschapv2*; Default: ) | Ordered list of EAP methods used for authentication. |
| **identity** (*string*; Default: ) | Supplicant identity used for EAP authentication. |
| **interface** (*string*; Default: ) | Name of the interface the client will run on. |
| **password** (*string*; Default: ) *[sensitive](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/configuration-management/list-of-menus-with-sensitive-parameters.md)* | Cleartext password for supplicant. |

### Read only properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **status** (*authenticated \| authenticating \| disabled*) | Possible statuses:authenticated - the client has successfully authenticated.authenticating - the server is reached and the authentication process is ongoing.disabled - the client is disabled.error - an internal error has occurred.interface is down - the parent interface is not running.rejected - the server denied the authentication. |

## Server

---

A RouterOS dot1x server acts as an authenticator. An interface where dot1x server is enabled will block all traffic except for EAPOL packets which are used for the authentication. After the client is successfully authenticated, the interface will accept all received traffic on the port. If the interface is connected to a shared medium with multiple hosts, the traffic will be accepted from all hosts when at least one client is successfully authenticated. However, it is possible to [configure dynamic switch rules](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/dot1x.md#dynamic-switch-rule-configuration) to accept only the authenticated user source MAC address and drop all other source MAC addresses. In case of failed authentication, it is possible to accept the traffic with a dedicated port VLAN ID.

:::warning
When a dot1x server is created on a bridge port, the bridge should be running (R/M)STP, otherwise EAP packets from the client will not be correctly accepted. The bridge interface is created with `protocol-mode=rstp` by default. If the bridge port should not send any BPDUs or any received BPDUs should be ignored, use `edge=yes` configuration on bridge ports.

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/dot1x/server`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **accounting** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Whether to send RADIUS accounting requests to the authentication server. |
| **auth-timeout** (*time*; Default: **1m**) | Total time available for EAP authentication. |
| **auth-types** (*dot1x \| mac-auth*; Default: **dot1x**) | Used authentication type on a server interface. When both options are selected at the same time, the server will prefer `dot1x` authentication type and only after 3 `retrans-timeout` periods, the authentication type will fall back to `mac-auth`. In order for `mac-auth` authentication type to work, the server interface should receive at least one frame containing a client's device source MAC address. |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Short description of the entry. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Whether server config is enabled or not. |
| **guest-vlan-id** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **!guest-vlan-id**) | Assigned VLAN when end devices do not support `dot1x` authentication and no `mac-auth` fall back is configured. The setting will apply after 3 `retrans-timeout` periods. Once a dot1x enabled client is created and successful re-authentication has happened, the port is removed from the guest VLAN. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge `vlan-filtering` is enabled. By default, guest VLAN is disabled. |
| **interface** (*string*; Default: ) | Name of the interface or interface list the server will run on. |
| **interim-update** (*time*; Default: **0s**) | Interval between scheduled RADIUS Interim-Update messages. |
| **mac-auth-mode** (*mac-as-username \| mac-as-username-and-password*; Default: **mac-as-username**) | Allows controlling User-Name and User-Password RADIUS attributes when using MAC authentication. |
| **radius-mac-format** (*XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX \| XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX \| XXXXXXXXXXXX \| xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx \| xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx \| xxxxxxxxxxxx*; Default: **XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX**) | Controls how the MAC address of the client is encoded in the User-Name and User-Password attributes when using MAC authentication. |
| **reauth-period**(*time*; Default: **!reauth-period**) | Enables server port re-authentication. When enabled with `dot1x` authentication type, the server will try to re-authenticate a client by sending EAP-Request Identity to the client. When enabled with `mac-auth` authentication type, the server will try to re-authenticate a client with the RADIUS server by using the last seen MAC address. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version. By default, re-authentication is disabled. |
| **reject-vlan-id** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **!reject-vlan-id**) | Assigned VLAN when authentication failed and a RADIUS server responded with an Access-Reject message. This property will not apply if the RADIUS server is not responding at all, the client authentication will simply timeout and the service will be unavailable. This property only has an effect when bridge `vlan-filtering` is enabled. By default, reject VLAN is disabled. |
| **retrans-timeout** (*time*; Default: **30s**) | Time interval between message re-transmissions if no response is received from supplicant. |
| **server-fail-vlan-id** (*integer: 1..4094*; Default: **!server-fail-vlan-id**) | Assigned VLAN when the RADIUS server is not responding and the request timeout has elapsed. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge `vlan-filtering` is enabled. By default, server-fail VLAN is disabled. |

Currently authenticated clients are listed in the active menu (read-only properties).

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/dot1x/server/active`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **auth-info** (*string*) | Authentication information: dot1xdot1x (guest vlan)dot1x (reject vlan)dot1x (server fail vlan)mac-authmac-auth (reject vlan)mac-auth (server fail vlan) |
| **client-mac** (*mac-address*) | MAC Address of the supplicant. |
| **interface** (*string*) | Name of the interface. |
| **session-id** (*string*) | Unique session identifier. |
| **username** (*string*) | Identity of the supplicant. |
| **vlan-id** (*string*) | Untagged VLAN ID that is assigned to the interface. VLAN ID filtering must be enabled on bridge. |

Statuses of all active dot1x server interfaces are listed in the state menu (read-only properties).

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/dot1x/server/state`

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **interface** (*string*) | Name of the interface. |
| **status** (*string*) | Possible interface statuses:authorized - access to the interface is granted;iface-down - the interface is not running;rejected-holding - access was rejected by the RADIUS server;un-authorized - access to the interface is not granted. |

## Examples

Described below are the most common configuration examples for dot1x server and client.

### RouterOS Authenticator configuration

![](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/img/dot1x-01.webp)

Start off by adding a new RADIUS client. The authentication server (RADIUS) does not necessarily have to be in the same LAN as authenticator, but it must be reachable from the authenticator, so any firewall limitations must be considered.

```ros
/radius 
add address=10.1.2.3 secret=radiussecret service=dot1x
```

:::warning
If RADIUS communication is done over a public network, it is advised to use RadSec for RADIUS communication. More information: [RADIUS](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/radius.md)

:::

Add new dot1x server instances.

```ros
/interface/dot1x/server
add interface=ether2 interim-update=30s comment=accounted
add interface=ether12 accounting=no comment=notaccounted
```

#### Port based VLAN ID assignment

It is possible to assign an authenticated interface to a specific VLAN ID using bridge VLAN filtering. This can be done using RADIUS Tunnel-Type, Tunnel-Medium-Type and Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attributes. Note that only devices with hardware offloaded VLAN filtering will be able to do this in the switch chip.

First of all, make sure the interface is added to a bridge which has VLAN filtering enabled.

```ros
/interface/bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether12
```

It is necessary to add static VLAN configuration for tagged VLAN traffic to be sent over the ether1 interface.

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=2
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=12
```

With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, Tunnel attributes are received in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server:

```text
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 64 from 10.1.2.3:1812
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Type = 13 
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Medium-Type = 6 
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Private-Group-ID = "12" 
(..)
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     User-Name = "dot1x-user" 
```

The VLAN ID is now present in the active session list and untagged ports are added to the previously created static VLAN configuration.

```ros
/interface/dot1x/server/active/print 
  0 interface=ether12 username="dot1x-user" client-mac=00:0C:42:EB:71:F6 session-id="86b00006" vlan-id=12
```

```ros
/interface/bridge/vlan/print detail 
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic 
 0 D bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=1 tagged="" untagged="" current-tagged="" current-untagged=bridge1,ether3 

 1   bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=2 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether2 

 2   bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=12 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether12 
```

#### Dynamic switch rule configuration

In some network configurations, additional access rules are needed for a particular supplicant to restrict or allow certain network services. This can be done using a Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute, please see the [RADIUS vendor dictionary](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/radius.md). When a client is successfully authenticated by an authentication server, the server can pass back the Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute. Based on the received information, the authenticator will create dynamic access rules on a switch port where the client resides. These rules will be active as long as the client session is active and the interface is running. There are certain orders and restrictions regarding correct switch rule implementation:

- The `mac-protocol`, `src-mac-address` (available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), `src-address` (IPv4/mask, available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), `dst-address` (IPv4/mask), `protocol` (IPv4) `src-port` (L4, available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), `dst-port` (L4) conditional parameters are supported.
- Hexadecimal or decimal representation can be used for `mac-protocol` and `protocol` parameters (e.g. `protocol 17` or `protocol 0x11`).
- The `src-port` and `dst-port` support single or range values (e.g. `src-port 10` or `src-port 10-20`).
- The `src-mac-address` supports "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" or "xxxxxxxxxxxx" formats, and a switch rule without any source MAC address can be set with "none" keyword (e.g.`src-mac-address none`).
- The `src-mac-address` (if not already set by the attribute)`, switch` and `ports` conditional parameters are automatically set for each rule
- Each rule should end with an action property, supported values are either **drop** or **allow**. If no action property is set, the default **allow** value will be used.
- Multiple rules are supported for a single supplicant and they must be separated by a comma ",".

Below are some examples of Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attributes and dynamic switch rules they create:

```ros
# Drop ARP frames (EtherType: 0x0806 or 2054)
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2054 action drop"

/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF mac-protocol=arp copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports=""

# Allow UDP (IP protocol: 0x11 or 17) destination port 100 and drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "protocol 17 dst-port 100 action allow, action drop"

/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF protocol=udp dst-port=100 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no 

 1  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports=""

# Allow only authenticated source MAC address, drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "action allow, src-mac-address none action drop"

/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:01:6D:EB/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no 

 1  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports="" 
```

In our example, Supplicant2 on ether2 is only allowed to access the 192.168.50.0/24 network with UDP destination port 50; all other traffic should be dropped. First, make sure that hardware offloading is working on bridge ports, otherwise switch rules might not work properly.

```ros
/interface/bridge/port/print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload 
 #     INTERFACE                   BRIDGE                   HW  PVID PRIORITY  PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST    HORIZON
 0   H ether1                      bridge1                  yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 1   H ether2                      bridge1                  yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
 2   H ether12                     bridge1                  yes    1     0x80         10                 10       none
```

With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, the Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute is received in the Access-Accept message from the Radius server:

```text
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 121 from 10.1.2.3:1812 
(..)
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet     MT-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2048 dst-address 192.168.50.0/24 dst-port 50 protocol 17 action allow,action drop"
```

The dynamic switch rules are now present under the switch menu:

```ros
/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/print 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether2 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF mac-protocol=ip dst-address=192.168.50.0/24 protocol=udp dst-port=50 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no 

 1  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether2 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports="" 
```

:::warning
Dynamic switch rules will only apply to RouterBoards with switch rule support - MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch and devices with QCA8337, Atheros8327 and Atheros8316 switch chips. CRS1xx/2xx series switches do not support this functionality. Take into consideration the maximum number of rules for each device, see [MikroTik devices with Marvell Prestera switch](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/marvell-prestera-switch-chip-features.md#models) and [basic switch chip table](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/bridging-and-switching/switch-chip-features.md)

### RouterOS Supplicant configuration

CA certificates are required for `eap-tls, eap-ttls` and `eap-peap` authentication methods. Additionally a client certificate is required for `eap-tls` method. For this example we have already imported a P12 certificate bundle with self-signed client and CA certificates. For more information on how to import certificates in RouterOS, please visit [System/Certificates](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates.md).

```ros
/certificate/print 
Flags: K - private-key, L - crl, C - smart-card-key, A - authority, I - issued, R - revoked, E - expired, T - trusted 
 #         NAME                                            COMMON-NAME                                         SUBJECT-ALT-NAME                             FINGERPRINT                                        
 0 K  A  T dot1x-client                                    ez_dot1x-client                                     IP:10.1.2.34
 1  L A  T dot1x CA                                        ca            
```

Simply add a new dot1x client instance that will initiate the authentication process.

```ros
/interface/dot1x/client
add anon-identity=anonymous client-certificate=dot1x-client eap-methods=eap-tls identity=dot1x-user interface=ether1 password=dot1xtest
```

If authentication was successful, the interface should have status authenticated.

```ros
/interface/dot1x/client/print 
Flags: I - inactive, X - disabled 
  0   interface=ether1 eap-methods=eap-tls identity="dot1x-user" password="dot1xtest" anon-identity="anonymous" client-certificate=dot1x-client status="authenticated"
```
