# PPP AAA

## Summary

**Sub-menu:** `/ppp`

The MikroTik RouterOS provides scalable Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) functionality.

Local authentication is performed using the User Database and the Profile Database. The actual configuration for the given user is composed using the respective user record from the User Database, the associated item from the Profile Database, and the item in the Profile database which is set as default for a given service the user is authenticating to. Default profile settings from the Profile database have the lowest priority while the user access record settings from the User Database have the highest priority with the only exception being that particular IP addresses take precedence over IP pools in the local-address and remote-address settings, which are described later on.

Support for RADIUS authentication gives the ISP or network administrator the ability to manage PPP user access and accounting from one server throughout a large network. The MikroTik RouterOS has a [RADIUS client](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/authentication-authorization-accounting/radius.md) that can authenticate for PPP, [PPPoE](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/pppoe/index.md), [PPTP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/pptp.md), [L2TP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/l2tp/index.md), [OpenVPN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/openvpn.md), and ISDN connections. The attributes received from the RADIUS server override the ones set in the default profile, but if some parameters are not received, they are taken from the respective default profile.

## User Profiles

**Sub-menu:** `/ppp/profile`

PPP profiles are used to define default values for user access records stored under `/ppp/secret` submenu. Settings in `/ppp/secret` User Database override corresponding `/ppp/profile` settings except that single IP addresses always take precedence over IP pools when specified as local-address or remote-address parameters.

### Properties

All rates are measured in bits per second, unless followed by an optional 'k' suffix (kilobits per second) or 'M' suffix (megabits per second). If tx-rate is not specified, rx-rate serves as tx-rate too. The same applies to tx-burst-rate, tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate are used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as default. Priority takes values 1..8, where 1 implies the highest priority, but 8 - the lowest. If rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min are not specified rx-rate and tx-rate values are used. The rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min values can not exceed rx-rate and tx-rate values. |

| **use-encryption** (*yes \| no \| default \| require*; Default: **default**) | Specifies whether to use data encryption or not.yes - enable data encryptionno - disable data encryptiondefault - derive this value from the interface default profile; same as no if this is the interface default profilerequire - explicitly requires encryptionThis setting does not work on OVPN and SSTP tunnels. |
| **use-ipv6** (*yes \| no \| default \| require*; Default: **default**) | Specifies whether to allow IPv6. By default, it is enabled if IPv6 package is installed.yes - enable IPv6 supportno - disable IPv6 supportdefault - derive this value from the interface default profile; same as no if this is the interface default profilerequire - explicitly requires IPv6 support |
| **use-mpls** (*yes \| no \| default \| require*; Default: **default**) | Specifies whether to allow MPLS over PPP.yes - enable MPLS supportno - disable MPLS supportdefault - derive this value from the interface default profile; same as no if this is the interface default profilerequire - explicitly requires MPLS support |

### Notes

The two default profiles cannot be removed:

```ros
[admin@rb13] /ppp/profile> print
Flags: * - default
 0 * name="default" use-compression=no use-encryption=no only-one=no
     change-tcp-mss=yes
 1 * name="default-encryption" use-compression=default use-encryption=yes
     only-one=default change-tcp-mss=default
[admin@rb13] /ppp/profile>
```

*incoming-filter* and *outgoing-filter* arguments add dynamic jump rules to chain *ppp*, where the jump-target argument will be equal to the *incoming-filter* or *outgoing-filter* argument in the profile. Therefore, chain *ppp* should be manually added before changing these arguments.

Only-one parameter is ignored if RADIUS authentication is used.

PPP tunnels use LCP protocol for MTU negotiation, it happens right when connection is established. Framed MTU attribute is not supported, as it is sent only after authentication with Radius.

## User Database

| **routes** (*string*; Default: ) | Routes that appear on the server when the client is connected. The route format is: dst-address gateway metric (for example, 10.1.0.0/ 24 10.0.0.1 1). Other syntax is not acceptable since it can be represented incorrectly. Several routes may be specified and separated with commas. This parameter will be ignored for [OpenVPN](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/openvpn.md). |
| **service** (*any \| async \| isdn \| l2tp \| pppoe \| pptp \| ovpn \| sstp*; Default: **any**) | Specifies the services that a particular user will be able to use. |

## Active Users

**Sub-menu:** `/ppp/active`

This submenu allows monitoring active (connected) users.

The `/ppp/active/print` command will show all currently connected users.

The `/ppp/active/print stats` command will show received/sent bytes and packets

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |

| **bytes** (*integer*) | Number of bytes transferred through this connection. The first figure represents the amount of transmitted traffic from the router's point of view, while the second one shows the amount of received traffic. |
| **caller-id** (*string*) | For  [PPTP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/pptp.md) and  [L2TP](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/l2tp/index.md) it is the IP address the client connected from. For  [PPPoE](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/virtual-private-networks/pppoe/index.md), it is the MAC address the client connected from. |
| **encoding** (*string*) | Shows encryption and encoding (separated with '/' if asymmetric) being used in this connection |
| **limit-bytes-in** (*integer*) | The maximum number of bytes the user is allowed to send to the router. |

## Remote AAA

**Sub-menu:** `/ppp/aaa`

Settings in this submenu allow setting RADIUS accounting and authentication. Note that the RADIUS user database is consulted only if the required username is not found in the local user database.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **accounting** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Enable RADIUS accounting |
| **interim-update** (*time*; Default: **0s**) | Interim-Update time interval |
| **use-radius** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enable user authentication via RADIUS. If an entry in the local secret database is not found, then the client will be authenticated via RADIUS. |
| **enable-ipv6-accounting** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Enable IPv6 separate accounting. PPP service counts Layer2, IPv4 and IPv6 data all together when reporting network usage statistics to the RADIUS server by default. If it is required to differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, then this option can be enabled. Prerequisites for it to work are that the prefix must be assigned to the client through PPP service and also rate-limit must be provided. Dynamically created queue statistics will be used as counters for IPv6 data, which then will be included in accounting packets as separate IPv6 statistics attributes. This will not work for prefixes assigned by a dynamically created DHCPv6 server due to the provided prefix pool or PPP/Profile configuration. Then prefix assignment is handled by DHCP service, not PPP, thus accounting can not be managed by PPP service. |

## Examples

#### Add new profile

To add the profile ex that assigns the router itself the 10.0.0.1 address, and the addresses from the ex pool to the clients, filtering traffic coming from clients through mypppclients chain:

```ros
[admin@rb13] /ppp/profile> add name=ex local-address=10.0.0.1 remote-address=ex incoming-filter=mypppclients
[admin@rb13] /ppp/profile> print
Flags: * - default
 0 * name="default" use-compression=no use-vj-compression=no use-encryption=no only-one=no
     change-tcp-mss=yes
 1   name="ex" local-address=10.0.0.1 remote-address=ex use-compression=default
     use-vj-compression=default use-encryption=default only-one=default change-tcp-mss=default
     incoming-filter=mypppclients
 2 * name="default-encryption" use-compression=default use-vj-compression=default use-encryption=yes
     only-one=default change-tcp-mss=default
[admin@rb13] /ppp/profile>
```

#### Add new user

To add the user "ex" with password "lkjrht" and profile "ex" available for PPTP service only, enter the following command:

```ros
[admin@rb13] /ppp/secret> add name=ex password=lkjrht service=pptp profile=ex
[admin@rb13] /ppp/secret> print
Flags: X - disabled
 #   NAME                SERVICE CALLER-ID         PASSWORD          PROFILE            REMOTE-ADDRESS
 0   ex                  pptp                      lkjrht            ex                 0.0.0.0
[admin@rb13] /ppp/secret>
```
