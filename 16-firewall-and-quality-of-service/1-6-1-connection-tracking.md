# Connection tracking

Introduction Connection states FastTrack Requirements Example Connection tracking settings Properties Connection List Properties

## Introduction

Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up that connection.

NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way.

Because of connection tracking you can use stateful firewall functionality even with stateless protocols such as UDP.

Firewall features affected by connection tracking:

NAT firewall: connection-bytes connection-mark connection-type connection-state connection-limit connection-rate layer7-protocol new-connection-mark tarpit

List of tracked connections can be seen in /ip firewall connection for IPv4 and /ipv6 firewall connection for IPv6.

## Connection states

Based on connection table entries arrived packet can get assigned one of the connection states: new, invalid, established, related, or untracked.

There are two different methods when the packet is considered new. The first one is in the case of stateless connections (like UDP) when there is no connection entry in the connection table. The other one is in the case of a stateful protocol (TCP). In this case, a new packet that starts a new connection is always a TCP packet with an SYN flag.

If a packet is not new it can belong to either an established or related connection or not belong to any connection making it invalid. A packet with an establis hed state, as most of you already guessed, belongs to an existing connection from the connection tracking table. A related state is very similar, except that the packet belongs to a connection that is related to one of the existing connections, for example, ICMP error packets or FTP data connection packets.

Connection state notrack is a special case when RAW firewall rules are used to exclude connection from connection tracking. This rule would make all forwarded traffic bypass the connection tracking, improving packet processing speed through the device.

Any other packet is considered invalid and in most cases should be dropped.

Based on this information we can set a basic set of filter rules to speed up packet filtering and reduce the load on the CPU by accepting established/related packets, dropping invalid packets, and working on more detailed filtering only for new packets.

ip firewall filter add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop comment="Drop Invalid connections" add chain=input connection-state=established,related,untracked action=accept comment="Allow Established/Related /Untracked connections

Such a rule set must not be applied on routers with asymmetric routing, because asymmetrically routed packets may be considered invalid and dropped.

## FastTrack

IPv4 FastTrack is a special handler that bypasses Linux facilities allowing for faster packet forwarding. The handler is used for TCP and UDP connections marked with "fasttrack-connection" action. IPv4 FastTrack handler supports NAT (SNAT, DNAT, or both).

Note that not all packets of the connection can be FastTracked, so it is likely to see some packets going through a slow path even though the connection is marked for FastTrack. This is the reason why fasttrack-connection is usually followed by an identical "*action=accept*" rule.

FastTrack-ed packets are bypassing:

firewall, connection tracking, simple queues, queue tree with parent=global, IP accounting, IPSec, hotspot universal client, VRF assignment

It is up to the administrator to make sure FastTrack does not interfere with other configuration.

Requirements

IPv4 FastTrack is active if the following conditions are met:

no mesh, metarouter interface configuration; sniffer, torch, or traffic generator is not running; /tool mac-scan is not actively used; /tool ip-scan is not actively used; FastPath and Route cache is enabled under IP/Settings

Example

For example, for SOHO routers with factory default configuration, you could FastTrack all LAN traffic with this one rule placed at the top of the Firewall Filter. The same configuration accept rule is required:

/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=fasttrack-connection connection-state=established,related /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related

Connection is FastTracked until the connection is closed, timed-out, or router is rebooted. Dummy rules will disappear only after FastTrack firewall rules will be deleted/disabled and the router rebooted. While FastPath and FastTrack both are enabled on the device only one can be active at a time.

Queues (except Queue Trees parented to interfaces), firewall filter, and mangle rules will not be applied for FastTracked traffic.

## Connection tracking settings

Connection tracking settings are managed from /ip firewall connection tracking menu.

Properties

Property Description

enabled (yes | Allows to disable or enable connection tracking. With disabled connection tracking  firewall features listed above will stop no | auto; working. If set to "auto" connection tracking is disabled until at least one firewall rule is added. Default: auto)

liberal-tcp-Enables or disables liberal TCP connection tracking by toggling the kernel parameter nf_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal. tracking (yes | When set to yes, the system mark only out of window RST segments as INVALID. no; Default: no) Enabling this setting may allow malformed packets that would otherwise be considered invalid by the firewall's con nection-state matcher. This can increase exposure to certain evasion techniques. This property should be enabled only when troubleshooting or working around known issues.

loose-tcp- tracking (yes; In case loose-tcp-tracking=yes, the 2nd part (SYN,ACK) and 3rd part (ACK) of the handshake without having seen the first Default: yes) initial SYN will be considered ESTABLISHED In case loose-tcp-tracking=no, the 2nd part (SYN,ACK) and 3rd part (ACK) without having seen the first initial SYN will be considered INVALID

tcp-syn-sent-TCP SYN timeout. timeout (time; Default: 5s)
