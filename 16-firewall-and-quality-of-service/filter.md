## Introduction

Firewall filters are used to allow or block specific packets forwarded to your local network, originating from your router, or destined to the router.

There are two methods on how to set up filtering:

allow specific traffic and drop everything else drop only malicious traffic, everything else is allowed.

Both methods have pros and cons, for example, from a security point of view first method is much more secure, but requires administrator input whenever traffic for a new service needs to be accepted. This strategy provides good control over the traffic and reduces the possibility of a breach because of service misconfiguration.

On the other hand, when securing a customer network it would be an administrative nightmare to accept all possible services that users may use. Therefore careful planning of the firewall is essential in advanced setups.

A firewall filter consists of three predefined chains that cannot be deleted:

input-used to process packets <u>entering the router</u> through one of the interfaces with the destination IP address which is one of the router's addresses. Packets passing through the router are not processed against the rules of the input chain forward-used to process packets <u>passing through the router</u> output-used to process packets <u>originating from the router</u> and leaving it through one of the interfaces. Packets passing through the router are not processed against the rules of the output chain

Firewall filter configuration is accessible from ip/firewall/filter menu for IPv4 and ipv6/firewall/filter menu for IPv6.

## Firewall Example

Lets look at basic firewall example to protect router itself and clients behind the router, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

### IPv4 firewall

Protect the router itself

Rules of thumb followed to set up the firewall:

work with new connections to decrease the load on a router; accept what you need drop everything else, log=yes could be set to log some attackers, but keep in mind that it may add some load to he CPU on heavy attacks.

We always start by accepting already known and accepted connections, so the first rule should be to accept "established" and "related" connections.

/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input comment="default configuration" connection-state=established,related

Now we can proceed by accepting some new connections, in our example we want to allow access ICMP protocol from any address and everything else only from 192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 address range. For that we create an address list and two firewall rules.

/ip firewall address-list add address=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 list=allowed_to_router /ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input src-address-list=allowed_to_router add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp

And lastly we drop everything else:

add action=drop chain=input

Complete set of just created rules:

/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input comment="default configuration" connection-state=established,related add action=accept chain=input src-address-list=allowed_to_router add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp add action=drop chain=input /ip firewall address-list add address=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 list=allowed_to_router

Protect the LAN devices

Concept in protecting the users is very similar, except that in this case we are blocking unwanted traffic and accepting everythign else.

At first we will create address-list with the name "not_in_internet" which we will use for the firewall filter rules:

/ip firewall address-list add address=0.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=172.16.0.0/12 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=192.168.0.0/16 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=10.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=169.254.0.0/16 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=127.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=224.0.0.0/4 comment=Multicast list=not_in_internet add address=198.18.0.0/15 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=192.0.0.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=192.0.2.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=198.51.100.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=203.0.113.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=100.64.0.0/10 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=240.0.0.0/4 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet add address=192.88.99.0/24 comment="6to4 relay Anycast [RFC 3068]" list=not_in_internet

Brief firewall filter rule explanation:

packets with connection-state=established,related added to FastTrack for faster data throughput, the firewall will work with new connections only; drop invalid connection and log them with prefix "invalid"; drop attempts to reach not public addresses from your local network, apply address-list=not_in_internet before, "bridge" is local network interface, log=yes attempts with prefix "!public_from_LAN"; drop incoming packets that are not NAT`ed, ether1 is public interface, log attempts with "!NAT" prefix; jump to ICMP chain to drop unwanted ICMP messages drop incoming packets from the Internet, which are not public IP addresses, ether1 is a public interface, log attempts with prefix "!public"; drop packets from LAN that does not have LAN IP, 192.168.88.0/24 is local network used subnet;

/ip firewall filter add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment=FastTrack connection-state=established,related add action=accept chain=forward comment="Established, Related" connection-state=established,related add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop invalid" connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=invalid add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop tries to reach not public addresses from LAN" dst-address- list=not_in_internet in-interface=bridge log=yes log-prefix=!public_from_LAN out-interface=!bridge add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop incoming packets that are not NAT`ted" connection-nat-state=!dstnat connection-state=new in-interface=ether1 log=yes log-prefix=!NAT add action=jump chain=forward protocol=icmp jump-target=icmp comment="jump to ICMP filters" add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop incoming from internet which is not public IP" in-interface=ether1 log=yes log-prefix=!public src-address-list=not_in_internet add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop packets from LAN that do not have LAN IP" in-interface=bridge log=yes log-prefix=LAN_!LAN src-address=!192.168.88.0/24

Allow only needed ICMP codes in "icmp" chain:

/ip firewall filter add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=0:0 action=accept \ comment="echo reply" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:0 action=accept \ comment="net unreachable" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:1 action=accept \ comment="host unreachable" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:4 action=accept \ comment="host unreachable fragmentation required" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=8:0 action=accept \ comment="allow echo request" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=11:0 action=accept \ comment="allow time exceed" add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=12:0 action=accept \ comment="allow parameter bad" add chain=icmp action=drop comment="deny all other types"

### IPv6 firewall

Protect the router itself

Very similar to IPv4 setup, except that we have to deal with more protocols required for IPv6 to function properly.

At first we create an address-list from which you allow access to the device:

/ipv6 firewall address-list add address=fd12:672e:6f65:8899::/64 list=allowed

Brief IPv6 firewall filter rule explanation:

work with new packets, accept established/related packets; drop link-local addresses from Internet(public) interface/interface-list; accept access to a router from link-local addresses, accept multicast addresses for management purposes, accept your source address-list for router access; drop anything else;

/ipv6 firewall filter add action=accept chain=input comment="allow established and related" connection-state=established,related add chain=input action=accept protocol=icmpv6 comment="accept ICMPv6" add chain=input action=accept protocol=udp port=33434-33534 comment="defconf: accept UDP traceroute" add chain=input action=accept protocol=udp dst-port=546 src-address=fe80::/10 comment="accept DHCPv6-Client prefix delegation." add action=drop chain=input in-interface=in_interface_name log=yes log-prefix=dropLL_from_public src- address=fe80::/10 add action=accept chain=input comment="allow allowed addresses" src-address-list=allowed add action=drop chain=input /ipv6 firewall address-list add address=fe80::/16 list=allowed add address=xxxx::/48 list=allowed add address=ff02::/16 comment=multicast list=allowed

In certain setups where the DHCPv6 relay is used, the src address of the packets may not be from the link-local range. In that case, the src- address parameter of rule #4 must be removed or adjusted to accept the relay address.

Protect the LAN devices

This step is more important than it is for IPv4. In IPv4 setups clients mostly have addresses from local address range and are NATed to public IP, that way they are not directly reachable from the public networks.

IPv6 is a different story. In most common setups, enabled IPv6 makes your clients available from the public networks, so proper firewall filter rules to protect your customers are mandatory.

In brief we will very basic LAN protection should:

accept established/related and work with new packets; drop invalid packets; accept ICMPv6 packets; accept new connections originated only from your clients to the public network; drop everything else.

/ipv6 firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward comment=established,related connection-state=established,related add action=drop chain=forward comment=invalid connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=ipv6,invalid add action=accept chain=forward comment=icmpv6 in-interface=!in_interface_name protocol=icmpv6 add action=accept chain=forward comment="local network" in-interface=!in_interface_name src-address-list=allowed add action=drop chain=forward log-prefix=IPV6

## Matchers

All matcher properties are common and listed here.

## Actions

Tables below shows list of filter specific actions and associated properties.

Property Description

action (action name; Default: accept) accept-accept the packet. A packet is not passed to the next firewall rule.

add-dst-to-address-list - add destination address to address list specified by address-list parameter add-src-to-address-list - add source address to address list specified by add ress-list parameter drop - silently drop the packet fasttrack-connection-process packets from a connection using FastPath by enabling FastTrack for the connection. IPv4 only. jump - jump to the user-defined chain specified by the value of jump- target parameter log-add a message to the system log containing the following data: in- interface, out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port->dst-ip:port and length of the packet. After a packet is matched it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar as passthrough passthrough-if a packet is matched by the rule, increase counter and go to next rule (useful for statistics) reject-drop the packet and send an ICMP reject message; this action allows ICMP reply specification, such as: prohibit or unreachable admin/host /network/port return-passes control back to the chain from where the jump took place tarpit-captures and holds TCP connections (replies with SYN/ACK to the inbound TCP SYN packet). IPv4 only.

hw-offload (no | yes; Default: yes) Enables or disables FastTrack hardware offloading. Supported only on switches with FastTrack offloading and when action=fasttrack-connection is set.

reject-with (icmp-no-route | icmp-admin-prohibited | icmp-not-Specifies ICMP error to be sent back if the packet is rejected. Applicable if actio neighbour | icmp-address-unreachable | icmp-port-unreachable | n=reject tcp-reset | icmp-err-src-routing-header | icmp-headers-too-long; Default: icmp-no-route) icmp-no-route: sends ICMP address no-route message. ICMP type 1, code 0 icmp-admin-prohibited: sends ICMP address prohibited message. ICMP type 1, code 1 icmp-not-neighbour: sends ICMP address not-member message. ICMP type 1, code 2 icmp-address-unreachable: sends ICMP address unreachable message. ICMP type 1, code 3 icmp-port-unreachable: sends ICMP port unreachable message. ICMP type 1, code 4 tcp-reset: sends ICMP resetting a TCP connection. ICMP type 1, code 6 icmp-err-src-routing-header: sends ICMP Error in Source Routing Header message. ICMP type 1, code 7 icmp-headers-too-long: sends ICMP Headers too long message. ICMP type 1, code 8

## RAW Filtering

The firewall RAW table allows to selectively bypass or drop packets before connection tracking, that way significantly reducing the load on the CPU. The tool is very useful for DoS/DDoS attack mitigation.

RAW filter configuration is accessible from ip/firewall/raw menu for IPv4 and ipv6/firewall/raw menu for IPv6.

The RAW table does not have matchers that depend on connection tracking ( like connection-state, layer7, etc.). If a packet is marked to bypass the connection tracking packet de-fragmentation will not occur.

Also RAW firewall can have rules only in two chains:

prerouting-used to process any packet entering the router output-used to process packets originated from the router and leaving it through one of the interfaces. Packets passing through the router are not processed against the rules of the output chain

And has one specific action:

Property Description

action (action name; Default: accept) notrack-do not send a packet to connection tracking. Useful when you still need to use regular firewall, but do not require connection tracking.

### Basic RAW Example

Let's assume that we have OSPF configuration, but due to connection tracking OSPF have adjacency problems. We can use RAW rules to fix this, by not sending OSPF packets to connection tracking.

/ip firewall raw add chain=prerouting protocol=ospf action=notrack add chain=output protocol=ospf action=notrack
