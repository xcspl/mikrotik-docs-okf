# DDoS Protection

## Introduction

A denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. There are several types of DDoS attacks, for example, HTTP flood, SYN flood, DNS amplification, etc.

## Protection against DDoS

### Configuration lines

These rules are only an improvement for firewall, do not forget to properly secure your device.

/ip firewall address-list add list=ddos-attackers add list=ddos-targets /ip firewall filter add chain=forward connection-state=new action=jump jump-target=detect-ddos add action=return chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s add action=add-dst-to-address-list address-list=ddos-targets address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=ddos-attackers address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos /ip firewall raw add action=drop chain=prerouting dst-address-list=ddos-targets src-address-list=ddos-attackers

### Configuration Explained

First, we will send every new connection to the specific firewall chain where we will detect DDoS:

/ip/firewall/filter/add chain=forward connection-state=new action=jump jump-target=detect-ddos

In the newly created chain, we will add the following rule with the "dst-limit" parameter. This parameter is written in the following format: dst-limit=count[ /time],burst,mode[/expire]. We will match 32 packets with 32 packet burst based on destination and source address flow, which renews every 10 seconds. The rule will work until a given rate is exceeded.

/ip/firewall/filter/add chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s action=return

So far all the legitimate traffic should go through the "action=return", but in the case of DoS/DDoS "dst-limit" buffer will be fulfilled and a rule will not "catch" any new traffic. Here come the next rules, which will deal with the attack. Let`s start with creating a list for attackers and victims which we will drop:

ip/firewall/address-list/add list=ddos-attackers ip/firewall/address-list/add list=ddos-targets ip/firewall/raw/add chain=prerouting action=drop src-address-list=ddos-attackers dst-address-list=ddos-targets

With the firewall filter section, we will add attackers in the "DDoS-attackers" and victims in list "ddos-targets" list:

/ip/firewall/filter/ add action=add-dst-to-address-list address-list=ddos-targets address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=ddos-attackers address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos

## SYN Attack

### SYN Flood

An SYN flood is a form of DoS attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. Fortunately, in RouterOS we have a specific feature for such an attack:

/ip/settings/set tcp-syncookies=yes

The feature works by sending back ACK packets that contain a little cryptographic hash, which the responding client will echo back with as part of its SYN- ACK packet. If the kernel doesn't see this "cookie" in the reply packet, it will assume the connection is bogus and drop it.

### SYN-ACK Flood

An SYN-ACK flood is an attack method that involves sending a target server spoofed SYN-ACK packet at a high rate. The server requires significant resources to process such packets out-of-order (not in accordance with the normal SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK TCP three-way handshake mechanism), it can become so busy handling the attack traffic, that it cannot handle legitimate traffic and hence the attackers achieve a DoS/DDoS condition. In RouterOS, we can configure similar rules from the previously mentioned example, but more specifically for SYN-ACK flood:

/ip/firewall/filter add action=return chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s protocol=tcp tcp-flags=syn,ack
